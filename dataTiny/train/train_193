mr. trump goes to washington. %$* 0
but if you think he's toning it down on capitol hill, you don't know trump. %$* 1
we are led by very, very stupid people. %$* 0
very, very stupid people. %$* 0
we cannot let it continue. %$* 1
this is cnn tonight. %$* 0
i'm don lemon. %$* 0
meanwhile, the gloves are off tonight why mild mannered dr. ben carson is going after trump. %$* 0
plus, why glenn beck tells me this. %$* 1
i don't trust anybody on our side. %$* 0
and i don't trust anybody on their side. %$* 1
and what you don't see in this shocking video of the shooting death of walter scott, will this enhanced video change the case? %$* 0
we will discuss that and more. %$* 0
but i want to begin with our breaking news tonight. %$* 0
a war words breaking out among the outsider candidates for the republican nomination. %$* 0
carly fiorina fires back at donald trump as he fires back at ben carson. %$* 0
joining me now, chris moody, senior reporter for cnn politics, amanda carpenter, former communications corrector for senator ted cruz, democratic strategist jamal simmons, and scottie nell hughes, news director of the tea party news network. %$* 0
good evening to all of you. %$* 0
glad to have you here. %$* 0
amanda, you first. %$* 0
first it is trump versus fiorina. %$* 0
rolling stone is out with a new piece on donald trump where they followed him on the campaign trail and they report a behind the scenes moment where he talks about carly fiorina. %$* 0
and look, here's what he writes. %$* 0
here's what they write, i should say. %$* 0
it says, "when the anchor throws to carly fiorina for her reaction to donald trump's momentum, trump's expression sours in a schoolboy disgusts as the camera bores in on fiorina. %$* 0
"look at that face," he cries. %$* 0
would anyone vote for that? %$* 0
can you imagine the face of our next president?" %$* 0
the laughter grows halting and faint behind him. %$* 0
'i mean, she's a woman. %$* 0
and i'm not supposed to say bad things, but, really, folks, come on. %$* 0
are we serious?" %$* 0
and then carly fiorina just spoke out about this on fox news. %$* 0
take a look. %$* 1
i think those comments speak for themselves. %$* 0
and all the many, many, many thousands of voters out there that are helping me climb in the polls, yes, they're very serious. %$* 1
what do you take that to mean? %$* 0
"look at that face? %$* 0
would any and all vote for that?" %$* 1
i have no idea. %$* 0
and, you know, obvious -- you know, honestly, megyn, i'm not going to spend a single cycle wondering what donald trump means. %$* 0
but maybe, just maybe, i'm getting under his skin a little bit because i am climbing in the polls. %$* 1
your reaction, amanda? %$* 1
well, listen. %$* 0
donald trump is the understatement of the year. %$* 0
had the problem when it comes to women. %$* 0
we've seen it with megyn kelly. %$* 0
we've seen it with carly fiorina. %$* 0
and i get the impression that unless you're someone that competes in a donald trump he really doesn't care about what you have to say. %$* 0
you know, it's really hard for me. %$* 0
it's someone who wants to see someone come in and shake up washington. %$* 0
when donald trump is good, he's very, very good. %$* 0
but when he's bad, he's bad. %$* 0
and he's very bad about women so many times. %$* 0
and i just -- i'm dreading how many more news cycles i'm going to have to go through when he insults women again and again and again. %$* 1
well, scottie, i see you shaking, do you think that this place into the idea that trump has an issue with women? %$* 1
i absolutely disagree. %$* 0
i mean, let's just say that trump is equal opportunity across the board. %$* 0
it's not like he's just going after women. %$* 0
he's going after women and men and anybody else that continues to take that first step against going against him. %$* 0
carly has taken some shots at donald trump. %$* 0
he's just trying to get under her skin. %$* 0
it's the exact opposite. %$* 0
and he's the one that's obviously doing it. %$* 1
but, scottie, to our knowledge and to your knowledge, have you ever heard him say anything like, hey, look at that face on jeb bush, look at the face on ben carson. %$* 0
oh, look at that face on ted cruz? %$* 1
yes, but you know what, but here's the deal. %$* 0
the thing about carly that you know, i'll give her some comments. %$* 0
i mean, at least she was respectful on her comments back. %$* 0
but if you're really running as a president for a -- as a female, you want to be elected not based on your skin, on your color, on your face. %$* 0
it will be based on your credentials. %$* 0
and so, hopefully, any time a woman whether it's hillary or carly starts to bring in this female aspect, i actually think it looks quite pathetic. %$* 0
and it actually does worth for the war on women because they're the ones that are bringing that and it is an excuse. %$* 1
amanda, you want to respond to that, is that two women on the panel? %$* 1
yes. %$* 0
i think, sir, well, i think the saddest thing about this is that carly fiorina is now put in the position of having to respond to such a stupid comment, instead of talking about her thoughts on policy. %$* 0
she has to respond to what donald trump said about her looks. %$* 0
and that's just the saddest thing about this all. %$* 1
ok. %$* 1
but she was the one that first throw the punches. %$* 0
let's go back to this first debate. %$* 0
carly was the one that went after donald trump. %$* 1
so, it's background policy. %$* 1
what it has done on policy. %$* 0
but that's the key. %$* 0
i mean, that's how this works so. %$* 1
no, no. %$* 0
you're look -- why you look like it's not a policy position? %$* 1
ok. let's move on now. %$* 0
because now, it appears the gloves may have come off between the two, between ben carson and donald trump. %$* 0
i'm wondering if their friendship is over. %$* 0
and this is for you, jamal. %$* 0
first of all, dr. carson was asked about the biggest difference between trump and himself. %$* 0
here it is. %$* 0
ben carson,  u.s. presidential candidate:  i realize where my successes come from. %$* 0
and i don't, in anyway, deny my faith in god. %$* 0
and i think probably that's a big difference. %$* 0
that's a very big part of who i am. %$* 0
humility and fear of the lord. %$* 0
i don't get that impression with him. %$* 0
maybe i'm wrong, but i don't get that impression. %$* 0
jamal, i know you're a democratic strategist. %$* 0
but you know about strategy. %$* 0
and is there a strategy to this? %$* 0
and if so, what is it? %$* 1
you know, the thing about ben carson lately is he has been showing this really interesting introspective side of himself. %$* 0
and i think what people react to him is they know he's not one of the good boys, right? %$* 0
they know he's not part of the network. %$* 0
and then he is identifying himself as a strong man of faith. %$* 0
i mean, this is something that republican primary has got to carry some real weight. %$* 0
and we're seeing it with his poll number. %$* 0
and he just seems like he's going up over and over again. %$* 0
the question is, though, how long will it last until he starts to get some more policy question that is he's having trouble answering. %$* 1
and chris moody, i'm sure you were glued to my last interview with donald trump last week. %$* 0
because on this show i asked him about that. %$* 0
i said, the polls showed, you know, when the two men first were first tied in iowa. %$* 0
and i asked him if he was going to start taking dr. carson to task the way he was attacking jeb bush or hillary clinton. %$* 0
and here's what he said. %$* 1
i'm more of a counter puncher, as they would say in the boxing world. %$* 0
ben and i have gotten to know each other over the years. %$* 0
i like him. %$* 0
and, i don't know, i can't tell you what's going to happen because i really don't know. %$* 0
you know, politics is a very -- it's a very strange thing and a very strange place that you end up in. %$* 0
but i can tell you that he's somebody that i like on a personal basis. %$* 1
ok. that didn't take long for trump to respond because here's the counterpunch as he said. %$* 0
he said that, "wow, i'm a head of the field with the evangelicals. %$* 0
i'm so proud of this, and virtually every other group, and ben carson just took a swipe of me. %$* 0
so, chris, gloves are off of you? %$* 1
when you're in politics even your friends become enemies at least for a short time. %$* 0
and also when you're the front runner of anything, especially with the field with this many candidates, more than a dozen, you're going to be targeted. %$* 0
now with ben carson, especially in iowa, he has been really the sleeping giant in that state. %$* 0
for a lot of reporters to spend a lot of time there, they will tell you, keep an eye on ben carson because that, other than trump, is the only person you hear about consistently. %$* 0
now carson and trump, both have similar appeals. %$* 0
they're both %$* 0
outsiders. %$* 0
they both might have ideas that are different from some of the more conventional candidates. %$* 0
so, they're really vying for many of the same voters. %$* 0
so, it's really no surprise that at a certain point, the two would come to a head. %$* 0
i would say the same thing about people like ted cruz, as well. %$* 0
no matter how much all of these guys have gotten along, when it comes to really fighting for those votes in the end, they're still going to be differences. %$* 1
chris, is this strategy going to work for carson? %$* 1
look, ben carson was asked. %$* 0
what's the difference between you and donald trump. %$* 0
and he actually turned that question into something very hard-hitting questioning the sincerity of donald trump stake. %$* 0
i was very -- was actually kind of surprised that at how hard he went after him in that regard. %$* 0
but, it shows that ben carson has a little fight in him. %$* 0
you know, he -- donald trump called jeb bush kind of like the sleepy candidate. %$* 0
but ben carson is really very subdued in a lot of ways. %$* 0
but this is the first time i've really saw him come out to and against another candidate. %$* 0
he came out swinging for sure. %$* 1
well, sleepy or not, jeb bush was up late last night. %$* 0
well, he was on television late because they taped it earlier. %$* 1
i'm sure he watched it. %$* 1
yes. %$* 0
i did watch it. %$* 0
you know, they had a little fun on the first episode of the late show steven colbert. %$* 0
it was a great show, by the way. %$* 0
he took a swing at answering questions like trump would. %$* 0
look at this. %$* 1
i will build a wall between the united states and iran and make mexico pay for it. %$* 0
thank you. %$* 0
trucks are strong. %$* 0
i will turn the national mall into a luxury golf course. %$* 0
and china will respect that. %$* 1
yes. %$* 0
that was a clip that end up and i say, i didn't see that last night. %$* 0
but do you -- who does this -- who stands more to gain here? %$* 0
is it jeb bush or is it ben carson? %$* 0
by taking shots at trump like this, jamal? %$* 0
simmons:  oh, i think -- this thing here is that jeb bush %$* 0
has got a punch up to trump because he got to make sure that he makes it into the news. %$* 0
so, this is we're talking about from his appearance last night is his fight with trump. %$* 0
so, i think he's going to be the one that really tries to take it to trump over the course of the next few weeks. %$* 0
is this the jeb bush that we need to see on the campaign trail, scottie? %$* 1
actually, you know, jeb bush last night after watching that segment, i actually thought we needed to put colbert in his place. %$* 0
you know, you can sit there, jeb bush is basically like a potato. %$* 0
you can dress him up, you can put all the toppings you want on him. %$* 0
but in the end, he's still a spud, a very boring spud. %$* 0
and so, if anything, i think that from what we learn from last night was even when you put him on a debut show, the only thing you're talking about is his comments about trump, the front runner. %$* 0
so, i think it was accentuate heard him. %$* 0
and the reason why ben carson is going after trump, actually benefits jeb. %$* 0
because they know they can take out ben carson down the road. %$* 0
this is the new strategy of the establishment. %$* 0
they can't take trump out so they're going to let some of the conservatives in the race try it as well to see if it works. %$* 1
amanda, i know you have more to say and the rest of you as well. %$* 0
you have plenty of time. %$* 0
so, stay with me every one. %$* 0
when we come right back, donald trump versus pretty much everybody in washington. %$* 0
why he says you may get bored with winning if he is president. %$* 0
plus, glenn beck's warning for america and the new details on the shocking walter scott shooting. %$* 0
will it change the case? %$* 0
a fiery rhetoric today from donald trump at a rally on capitol hill blasting the iran nuclear deal, calling it incompetently negotiated. %$* 0
and then, this. %$* 1
we are led by very, very stupid people. %$* 0
very, very stupid people. %$* 0
we cannot let it continue. %$* 1
so, back with me now, chris moody, amanda carpenter, jamal simmons, and scottie nell hughes. %$* 0
amanda, you first. %$* 0
you heard the man. %$* 0
the country is led by very stupid people. %$* 0
the question is how divided republicans -- is the republican party, i should say right now on whether this kind of rhetoric is good or bad? %$* 0
carpenter:  well, i think there's a widespread agreement across the %$* 0
country that washington is broken. %$* 0
the people in charge aren't doing a good job. %$* 0
we are confronting things like a national -- incredibly rising national debt. %$* 0
a world debt is more hostile to america, in terms of terrorism. %$* 0
and so, when donald trump says things like this, it appeals to them. %$* 0
that said, the rhetoric is brash. %$* 0
no one disagreed with that. %$* 0
i don't think it's befitting someone who actually will be president. %$* 0
but it is striking a chord. %$* 0
and because people are so uncomfortable with the direction of this nation is going. %$* 1
but you know what, don. %$* 0
there's an underlying sentiment in the republican party that barack obama is not a smart man. %$* 0
and the one thing that i think you can sort of argue is that the president is probably a pretty smart man. %$* 0
you may not agree with what his choices are, you may not like his policies. %$* 0
that doesn't make him a stupid person. %$* 0
and i think there's something to that attack that is more than just, you know, oh, he's just not -- he's not getting it right. %$* 1
yes, because when you mentioned that, before you jumped in, i was going to say, if you look, you said the national debt is rising, the deficit is lower than it's been since before he took office. %$* 0
unemployment is down. %$* 0
the economy is doing better. %$* 1
that we haven't -- we're on that 18 million national debt. %$* 1
so, he's not a stupid man. %$* 0
i know that -- i know that's rhetoric for the campaign to, as jamal said, to sort of cast him as a stupid man who's doing -- who's incompetent as president, but he's actually done a pretty good job lately. %$* 1
well, but hold on a second. %$* 0
the target of the people at the rally wasn't necessarily just barack obama. %$* 0
a lot of them were talking about senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and john boehner, as well. %$* 0
the ire of the people in that rally they are mad at the republican congress because they aren't doing anything to stop this deal. %$* 0
so, don't think that anger is only directed at president obama over this because it's all around. %$* 1
so, chris, you were there. %$* 0
you spoke to some of the supporters at this rally. %$* 0
what do the folks have to say? %$* 1
amanda is exactly right. %$* 0
they're mad. %$* 0
they're mad as hell. %$* 0
i saw people -- and i went to a lot of tea party rally as i've covered them in the years. %$* 0
this seemed to be far more passionate even more incendiary. %$* 0
there is a guy carrying around a sign and it said, obama is better than hitler." %$* 0
and that spark debate among whether the sign was correct. %$* 0
we also saw a lot of other kinds of signs. %$* 0
we brought a video camera. %$* 0
take a look. %$* 1
i have a couple daughters in new york city and i sure wouldn't want to see them nuked. %$* 1
obama has the spirit of anti-christ. %$* 1
we heard of what's happened in nazi, germany. %$* 0
you know, and barack obama is a very similar man to hitler. %$* 1
if we didn't have donald trump, we would be helpless. %$* 0
donald has the personality to take no  and to pick fights with people who should have been put down and slammed decades ago. %$* 1
he's speaking to the people. %$* 0
and he's really saying what we feel. %$* 1
the only matter, they're scared. %$* 0
they're seeing this things happening not just as domestic policy. %$* 0
you remember the tea party back in the old days was mostly around the domestic policy, economics. %$* 0
and this really has branched out to something bigger. %$* 0
and something what a lot of people would argue as much higher stakes. %$* 0
and i think that increases the level of anxiety among a lot of people. %$* 1
let's ask the tea party lady who is here and that's scottie. %$* 0
i mean, scottie, but a lot of that is not really based in reality. %$* 0
it's not really what's happening in the country. %$* 0
is it just fear? %$* 1
no. %$* 0
it is a lot of fear, to be honest. %$* 0
and you're right. %$* 0
when we first started it was about fiscal policy. %$* 0
but now he has expanded national security and fiscal policy, which is a lot of the issues that this iran deal is dealing with. %$* 0
when you're sitting there and you're dealing with a leader that says that israel will be eliminated in 25 years, that actually infuriates many of the many people that were on the lawn on the capitol today that are now the tea party. %$* 0
evangelicals and the tea party kind of have merged a little bit. %$* 0
but when it comes down to -- it's not only judge the tea party that is angry. %$* 0
i believe there is also democrats right now. %$* 0
he's inspiring a divided democrat party. %$* 0
while you're seeing three candidates with three different views running for president and trying to sit there and appeal to people. %$* 0
so, it's not just the republicans right not that are angry or that are fearful. %$* 0
i think many are across the nation. %$* 0
that's why donald trump is winning. %$* 0
he's not just appealing to republicans. %$* 0
he's appealing to them all. %$* 0
lemon:  ok. well, let's look forward to the debate and talk about %$* 0
foreign policy. %$* 0
because i spoke with hugh hewitt last night in this program. %$* 0
he's going to be lobbying some tough questions he says, on the next gop debate about foreign policy. %$* 0
so, and to donald trump, to ben carson, and carly fiorina. %$* 0
these are outsider candidates. %$* 0
what do you think will happen on that front, jamal, in the debate? %$* 0
oh, i mean, it's pretty clear. %$* 0
i think they'll all, you know, they'll go at each other. %$* 0
they'll go at the establishment. %$* 0
i think this point that was just made a few minutes ago, that there's something about this. %$* 0
that's about the entire establishment in washington being angry at. %$* 0
that's true. %$* 0
and, you know, there are people in the democratic side that are angry about this. %$* 0
and you saw them with some of the bernie sanders rallies. %$* 0
the difference is the democrats are mad, the corporate chief who are actually making all of the money. %$* 0
i mean, the reality is the top 1 percent of the country is making as much money as the bottom 50 percent of the country. %$* 0
and that is really where we ought to be thinking about how do we get more people lifted up instead of going after government leaders who really, you know, aren't the ones who are the kleptomaniacs here. %$* 1
who do you think, chris, i want to ask you this and then look for the debate. %$* 0
quick answer on this note. %$* 0
who do you think the republicans are more upset at? %$* 0
are they more upset at their own establishment? %$* 0
or more upset at what's happening in the white house right now? %$* 1
you know, sometimes, it's hard to tell if you read a lot of the blogs on the right and you talk to like people on twitter as well. %$* 0
people, it's worse when it's someone in your own clan that you see as betrayed. %$* 1
so, if you look at the polls, the outsiders, you know, all of these establishment candidates most of them are not doing well. %$* 1
no, they're not doing well right now. %$* 0
now, this is all before anyone has spent more than a dime on campaign ads that will run on television. %$* 0
those things do swing the needle around, right? %$* 1
yes. %$* 1
so we -- we're going to see things changing a lot. %$* 0
but, no. %$* 0
people are mad not just -- and this is been obvious with trump. %$* 0
people are mad not just with barack obama or republicans but they're mad at john boehner, mitch mcconnell. %$* 0
you heard that today at the rally. %$* 0
if you ever mentioned those names at that rally today, immediate boos. %$* 0
possibly even louder if they mentioned president obama. %$* 0
lemon:  i wonder if they mention those names at the debate what's %$* 0
going to happen. %$* 0
we shall see, chris moody, amanda carpenter, jamal simmons, and scottie nell hughes. %$* 0
thank you. %$* 1
thank you, don. %$* 1
thanks. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 1
glenn beck is passionate about his opposition to the nuclear deal in iran. %$* 0
he tells me why, next. %$* 0
glenn beck is a fierce opponent of the nuclear deal with iran. %$* 0
and he spoke at today's rally on capitol hill. %$* 0
beck of course, is the founder of the blaze and the e author of "it is about islam." %$* 0
and he joins me now. %$* 0
hello, mr. beck. %$* 0
how did you feel about the rally today? %$* 0
how did it went? %$* 1
i don't know, don. %$* 0
i mean, i went bill o'reilly asked me last night, why are you even going? %$* 0
you know, this whole deal is done. %$* 0
and i said, i'm going, in the most selfish of ways, for me. %$* 0
i want to be on the record standing against the tide of insanity and the tide of death that we seem to be embracing from our police officers getting shot to the petri dishes of bodies in planned parenthood to the rape rooms and isis, and now this deal in iran. %$* 0
we've just seriously lost our way. %$* 0
i don't -- no politician is going to fix that. %$* 1
well, let's -- we have to listen to some of the politicians. %$* 0
i know donald trump says he's not won. %$* 0
well, he actually told me, he's admitted that he's won now. %$* 1
yes. %$* 1
donald trump, ted cruz, sarah palin, all were there. %$* 0
listen to what they said. %$* 1
never, ever, ever, in my life, have i seen any transaction so incompetently negotiated as our deal with iran. %$* 0
and i mean never. %$* 1
so, despite the rally, all the opposition and what you said, you know, you're tired of dealing with death, it seems like the president has the votes for the deal to survive. %$* 0
so, what do you think will happen? %$* 0
beck:  i don't know. %$* 0
you know, somebody asked me from a foreign paper %$* 0
when i walked off the stage, what happens when hillary clinton gets in? %$* 0
and i just looked at her as kind of i do it in a much kinder way than you, don. %$* 0
she just stunned me with that after what i said in my speech. %$* 0
and i said i have no idea. %$* 0
this is so far beyond politics now. %$* 0
i really, truly believe this is a time that americans, left and right, you know, conservative, republican, liberal and democrat, need to just put all of this stuff aside. %$* 0
you're an atheist, you believe in god, whatever. %$* 0
black, white. %$* 0
we've got to come together and start having a serious conversation of principles. %$* 0
and what we're talking now about is parties and politicians. %$* 0
can we talk about the principles behind this? %$* 0
this is going to be voted on probably on september 11th. %$* 0
if i would have said that five years ago, they would have made fun of me as much as i did when i said there would be a caliphate established in the middle east. %$* 0
yes. %$* 1
this is nuts. %$* 1
we keep talking about that about people coming together and just talking. %$* 0
what do you think is so bad about this? %$* 0
why is this so dangerous? %$* 0
what are the principles that you're talking about? %$* 1
because you can't -- look. %$* 0
don, you can't -- if i'm saying i'm going to kill you -- if i'm your neighbor, and i'm going to say to you every time i'm meeting with you, i'm going to kill you. %$* 0
i'm going to kill you and all of your family. %$* 0
i'm going to kill and i'm going to torture your children. %$* 0
meanwhile, your wife is out talking to your wife. %$* 0
and they decided to have a little conversation. %$* 0
and while they're talking and they're saying, hey, we've got to get together and we've got to be friends. %$* 0
and while they're doing that, i'm still looking over the fence to you and i'm saying i'm going to kill you, do you take the conversation that my wife is having with your wife seriously? %$* 1
well, what's the solution, glenn? %$* 1
what you do if you're in the situation with a neighbor is, you'll watch them and you'll say, hey, dude. %$* 0
i'll be -- my wife, your wives want to get together that's totally fine. %$* 0
but i want you to know, i'm watching you. %$* 0
the whole time, i'm watching you because i don't trust you. %$* 1
i don't want you to get upset with me, but you're sounding a lot like hillary clinton when you say i don't trust you. %$* 0
she said that this -- i think, and i'm paraphrasing her. %$* 0
she said this deal is really about -- it's not really about trust, it's about mistrust. %$* 0
listen. %$* 1
several republican candidates boast they'll tear up this agreement in 2017. %$* 0
more than a year after it's been implemented. %$* 0
that's not leadership. %$* 0
that's recklessness. %$* 0
it would set us right down the very dangerous path we've worked so hard to avoid. %$* 1
so, she said distract -- distrust and watch. %$* 0
what's your reaction to her statement? %$* 1
well, i mean, i'm going to set you off now. %$* 0
i don't really think i go to hillary clinton who says i didn't e-mail any secret documents. %$* 0
i don't know what you're talking about. %$* 0
i don't think i go to her for what we should trust and not trust. %$* 0
i don't think she's a good arbiter of that. %$* 1
but she did not put the deal. %$* 0
she helped it put together the deal, at least put it in motion she said there the state. %$* 1
i don't necessarily trust her. %$* 0
i don't trust, quite honestly, anybody in washington. %$* 0
i honestly, i sat there and i listened to the speeches that were given today. %$* 0
and i kept hearing trust. %$* 0
trust the government. %$* 0
trust this person. %$* 0
trust that person. %$* 0
so, i'm being forced who am i going to trust? %$* 0
i don't trust anybody on our side and i don't trust anybody on their side. %$* 0
i mean, we have to have a conversation on these guys are the biggest exporter of terror in the world. %$* 0
and we're giving them $150 billion. %$* 0
what do you think they're going to do with that? %$* 0
now, i don't understand. %$* 0
i don't think there's any good players here. %$* 0
but i don't understand why were so eager to embrace death in throughout all of our culture. %$* 0
don, you and i have talked about this. %$* 0
when you can't say all lives matter, without upsetting people say black lives matter. %$* 0
no. %$* 0
i understand. %$* 0
i really do understand. %$* 0
black lives matter, but so do white lives. %$* 0
so do asian lives, and hispanic lives. %$* 0
i get that. %$* 0
all lives matter. %$* 0
when we can't say that, when we've taken life and made it political, do you think we're really going to get to a solution on iran? %$* 0
no. %$* 1
you mentioned black lives matter. %$* 0
i want to play this clip that says sarah palin is at the event today on the topic. %$* 0
here it is. %$* 1
mr. president won't say it %$* 0
since he still hasn't called off the dogs. %$* 0
we'll say it. %$* 0
police officers and first responders all across this great land, we've got your back. %$* 0
we salute you. %$* 1
so, people are saying she called black lives matter, protesters, dogs. %$* 0
is that your interpretation? %$* 1
i don't even -- good god, don. %$* 0
really? %$* 0
that's what we're down to? %$* 0
i don't know if she did or not. %$* 0
but if that's what we're down to, we have to have a bigger conversation. %$* 0
if she called black lives matter dogs, then she was wrong for doing that. %$* 0
i don't know. %$* 0
i didn't -- i couldn't hear or understand what she was even saying. %$* 1
thank you, sir. %$* 1
god bless you, don. %$* 1
i appreciate it. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 0
thanks. %$* 1
and here is another case of justice in black and white. %$* 0
former tennis star, james blake says as many as five plain clothed officers tackled and handcuff him outside his manhattan hotel today. %$* 0
that is according to the new york daily news. %$* 0
blake is african-american. %$* 0
the officers involved are white. %$* 0
the nypd says, they were investigating the fraudulent sale of cell phones. %$* 0
once blake's identity was confirmed, he was released. %$* 0
we will follow up on this story. %$* 0
when we come right back, enhanced video of the shooting of walter scott. %$* 0
why attorneys for the former police officer charge with murder say he should be out on bail. %$* 0
in south carolina, former officer michael slager has been behind bars ever since he pulled walter scott over on april 4th, reportedly, for a broken brake light. %$* 0
scott was african-american, tried to run away and was shot in the back by slager. %$* 0
the shooting caught on camera by a witness. %$* 0
slager's attorneys now want him released on bail. %$* 0
and joining me now is shaun kent, attorney for michael slager. %$* 0
good evening, sir. %$* 0
shaun, your client is charged with murder. %$* 0
why should he be allowed out? %$* 1
well, don, the easiest way to describe is in the state of south carolina as with most states, have a bond solution. %$* 0
they have a way that you can get a bond. %$* 0
and one of the things that our courts concerns ourselves with is if it's a capital offense or any offense, whatsoever, people are entitled to a bond. %$* 0
and michael falls into that category. %$* 0
he's been accused of a crime and he fits under the statute that he has the right for a bond. %$* 0
and we believe that he is entitled to a bond. %$* 1
and the bond hearing is tomorrow, correct? %$* 1
the bond hearing is tomorrow at 2 o'clock, yes, sir. %$* 1
all right. %$* 0
so, you've filed court documents saying that walter scott had alcohol and traces of cocaine in his system. %$* 0
given that he was shot in the back five times... %$* 1
yes, sir. %$* 1
... do you -- and he was running away. %$* 0
why does it matter to show that? %$* 1
well, don, nobody is saying that what mr. scott had inside of his system matters. %$* 0
and i make sure i say this the right way. %$* 0
no one is saying that mr. slager knew what walter scott had in his system when he stopped him. %$* 0
however, it might offer some solace to some victims and to other folks. %$* 0
because we've been asked over and over again, why did walter scott run on that evening? %$* 0
why did he tried to avoid catch on that evening? %$* 0
why did he do the things that he do? %$* 0
and it might offer some benefits to those individuals that mr. scott did have alcohol and cocaine in his system that night. %$* 0
but no one is saying that is justification or as a rational or it's a reason for what happened. %$* 0
it just might explain why mr. scott ran and did the things that he did that night. %$* 1
and these are... %$* 1
but we're not saying that that's justification or an excuse at all. %$* 1
and these are official toxicology reports. %$* 0
it's from the fbi. %$* 0
it's not reports that you ordered. %$* 1
no, no. %$* 0
these aren't reports that we ordered ourselves. %$* 0
this is from the state law enforcement division and they ordered and did toxicology as they did with any case such as this. %$* 1
ok. %$* 0
so, if all of this information is true, why are we just hearing about this now? %$* 1
well, let me correct you right there, don. %$* 0
i don't want to say its new information. %$* 0
this is information that has always been outstanding. %$* 0
you'll have to ask others more important to me why this is just being released now. %$* 0
but this information has been outstanding since day one. %$* 0
our position is very simple. %$* 0
this information has been out there very clearly. %$* 1
but it has not been released to the public. %$* 1
the state law enforcement division -- it is not been released to the public. %$* 0
and i don't know why it hasn't been released to the public. %$* 0
but this isn't new information. %$* 0
this is information that has always existed. %$* 0
it has always been outstanding. %$* 0
and the narrative since day one has always been michael slager shot an unarmed black man in the back and then went so far as to lie about it. %$* 0
well, that's not the narrative that's actually true. %$* 0
when we see this and i don't want to call it new evidence or new information. %$* 0
but the information that has always existed shows that michael slager has told the truth since day one. %$* 0
he says he's accounted of what happened. %$* 0
and i don't understand why the state law enforcement division chose not to give everybody -- not this paul harvey quote, but the rest of the story. %$* 0
but for some reason they chose not. %$* 1
ok. let's talk about the rest of the information and that you're discussing here. %$* 0
because your documents also show the key evidence pertaining to the taser and the officer's uniform. %$* 0
what can you tell me about that? %$* 1
well, don, i'm not going to characterize what the state's evidence is. %$* 0
but the easiest way to describe it is michael slager told a very simple story. %$* 0
that he stopped the vehicle. %$* 0
once stopping the vehicle, the individual ran from the vehicle. %$* 0
and after running from the vehicle, this individual took his taser, tried to shoot him with the taser several times. %$* 0
an altercation occurred between the two individuals and that's what happened. %$* 0
our belief is the evidence that has been provided by the state law enforcement division, since that they had, since day one, has always shown at michael's story to be accurate. %$* 0
the entire time. %$* 1
so, as you're talking there... %$* 1
and that's something that anyone can look at. %$* 0
it's not something i've made up. %$* 0
it's not something that we've created. %$* 0
it's evidence that's always existed. %$* 1
ok. %$* 0
so, the video that we're showing, this is -- we've obtained this from the fbi. %$* 0
analysis video which shows enhanced images moments before the shooting. %$* 0
it appears to show the two men tussling on the ground. %$* 0
so, do you think that this enhanced video bolsters your case? %$* 1
well, i think i don't want to use the word bolster. %$* 0
i think what it does it adds corroboration to michael slager's story. %$* 0
michael slager has always said from the beginning this is what's happened. %$* 0
and unfortunately, all we've been able to see is the -- and i don't want to say the second part of the video, but we've only been able to see one clip of the video and no one has ever seen at the beginning. %$* 0
and so, the question again has to go through the state law enforcement division, why wasn't all of the information given? %$* 0
rather than just a clip to try to, basically, to try to scare people. %$* 0
is the easiest way to describe it. %$* 0
scare people as to what happened rather than telling the full account of what happened that day. %$* 1
ok. %$* 0
so, is there other information out there? %$* 0
did you enhance the dash board video or dash board audio to put together a time line and a narrative? %$* 0
because what we see, what we still see here is an unarmed man being shot in the back. %$* 1
don, the easiest way to describe it is we're doing everything in our power to provide a proper defense from michael slager and that's what we'll do. %$* 0
i'm going to discuss everything that we're going to do, to do that. %$* 0
but we're going to provide a defense for him. %$* 0
what we're trying to say at this point in time is we're trying to even the playing field. %$* 0
because the playing field that we've had so far is been one side of the narrative. %$* 0
and the narrative had been very clear from the state law enforcement division. %$* 0
michael slager shot an unarmed man and then lied about it. %$* 0
our position right now is he didn't lied about anything. %$* 0
he told his story as to what's happened. %$* 0
and in telling his story, for some reason, the state law enforcement division didn't want anyone to hear that side of the story. %$* 1
is it because... %$* 1
and that' a problem. %$* 1
i'm trying to, you know -- i don't know from reading, i should read between the lines here, but north charleston officials, are you saying -- because they were widely praised for the burden unrest in the city acting quickly in this case. %$* 0
so, by saying that, this information was not released, are you worried that your client has been treated unfairly? %$* 0
and that a narrative has been created? %$* 0
or that information has been suppressed in order to halt any unrest? %$* 1
charleston is a great city. %$* 0
and i think charleston has handled a situation as to where is it. %$* 0
as well as any city in the united states possibly could. %$* 0
i'm not going to cast this person is on the city of north charleston on the way that they handled the case. %$* 0
but i will specifically say, no. %$* 0
everything was not put forth the way it should have been. %$* 0
we haven't been told the total story. %$* 0
and i don't know the answer to that, don. %$* 0
i think the answer has to come from the state law enforcement division. %$* 1
shaun kent, thank you very much. %$* 0
and please come back. %$* 0
we would like to have you on after the bond hearing tomorrow. %$* 0
thank you. %$* 1
thank you so much, don. %$* 0
you have a great afternoon. %$* 1
i appreciate it. %$* 0
thank you. %$* 0
when we come right back, what walter scott's family members think of all of this. %$* 0
well, the former officer charged with murder and the death of walter scott be released on bail? %$* 0
i want to get the scott family's perspective now. %$* 0
so, joining me now is anthony scott, he's walter scott's brother, and chris stewart, attorney for walter scott's family. %$* 0
good evening, gentlemen. %$* 0
you heard the interview before. %$* 1
hi, don. %$* 0
yes, don. %$* 1
anthony, i'm going to give you the chance to respond to what you've just heard. %$* 0
but first, you know, it's just been over four months since walter was killed. %$* 0
how is the family doing? %$* 1
we're coming along, don. %$* 0
but it's been long and trying. %$* 0
and it's still day-by-day. %$* 0
and sometimes, it's some days are worse than other days. %$* 0
so you heard the interview before. %$* 0
yes. %$* 1
you -- the attorney wanted bail to be granted tomorrow. %$* 0
so, what do you think about that and what the attorney said? %$* 1
well, don, in america is our constitutional right to be offered bail and to be out on bond. %$* 0
and we're innocent until proven guilty. %$* 0
in this case, i think that officer slager is guilty of murder. %$* 0
but being that it's our constitutional right to be out on bail. %$* 0
i think that he will out of bail. %$* 0
now whether he gets out is another things but it's just the way the law in our judicial system is set up. %$* 0
so, there's nothing that we can do about that. %$* 0
and we have to live whatever decision is made and whether he gets out on bond or whether he doesn't. %$* 1
let me ask you specific and about the interview so that you can respond to them accurate. %$* 0
they say that your brother had drugs in his system and that there's more to the story than the video. %$* 0
do you care to respond to that? %$* 1
well, i don't know what more could be to the story. %$* 0
and, if he had drugs in his system, i don't see what difference that made in him running away unarmed and being gunned down the way that he was gunned down. %$* 0
lemon:  they say in the documents, walter's dna was on the tasers, %$* 0
that he grabbed the taser and that he tried to harm officer slager. %$* 0
do you think -- and then in the enhanced video, it shows a tussle. %$* 0
do you think that's possible? %$* 0
you know, regarding that, you know, that entire file that they have is filled with things that they're now twisting to fit their version of the story. %$* 0
let me read you something else that was in that file that they have. %$* 0
"the suspect then stood up and pointed the taser at officer slager. %$* 0
officer slager then drew his weapon as he was returning to a standing position and fire multiple times." %$* 0
this was three days after he killed walter scott given to his lieutenant. %$* 0
this is the reality of what happened. %$* 0
his attorney just said that michael slager has not lied about the situation. %$* 0
this doesn't match up. %$* 0
he didn't fire a standing position getting to a standing position. %$* 0
he let walter scott run 20 feet away and opened fire. %$* 0
let's just stay in reality and i think they need to do the same. %$* 1
and you said that they are maintaining it from the interview and from the document that all along, officer slager has given consistent statements since this all happened. %$* 1
absolutely untrue. %$* 0
you know, this large scuffle that they're now trying to say happened and they're trying to focus the first part of the video, which has always been out there on this big confrontation, this is the result of that big confrontation of rolling around on the ground. %$* 0
a scratch that i can get bumping into something getting out of bed. %$* 0
you know, what they're trying to do is shift this from the clearer murder that all of america and the world saw into some type of defense. %$* 0
they have to argue something. %$* 0
and i understand that. %$* 0
that's fine. %$* 0
but don't twist reality or try to assassinate a man's character twice. %$* 1
anthony, will you be in court tomorrow? %$* 0
will your family be there for that hearing? %$* 1
i will be in court. %$* 0
and, yes, my family will be in court tomorrow for the hearing. %$* 1
what happens next, anthony? %$* 1
we wait, see whether he gets out on bond and then we wait till he gets to trial. %$* 0
and then hopefully, we get that guilty verdict of murder for officer slager. %$* 1
yes. %$* 0
quite often we don't, you know, when someone has an allegation or what have you if we have, we only get one side. %$* 0
but i appreciate you coming on and responding to this because i know it is a tough time for you. %$* 0
and so, you responded directly to the officer's attorneys and i think that says a lot about you. %$* 0
and, again, i thank you. %$* 0
best of luck to you guys. %$* 1
we appreciate you brings us on, don. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 1
thanks a lot. %$* 1
we appreciate it. %$* 1
we'll be right back. %$* 0
study show that a sedentary lifestyle can be too serious cardiovascular issue of diabetes, even cancer. %$* 0
this week's cnn heroes doing something about that. %$* 1
i knew something had to change on my end to stay healthy. %$* 0
i go anywhere between 9 to 12 hours sitting at the desk. %$* 0
you may be working a lot, but you're at the desk sitting. %$* 0
how far do you think you could walk before you had to stop? %$* 0
the number one problem i see on my patient's face as a cardiologist is a sedentary lifestyle. %$* 0
i was frustrated at my ineffectiveness to create change in my patients. %$* 1
hello. %$* 1
how are you? %$* 1
i'm fine. %$* 1
so, i said how about if my family goes to the park, would you be interested in joining us? %$* 0
so, see you tomorrow at the walk? %$* 1
oh, yes. %$* 1
the response was phenomenal. %$* 0
i wanted to talk about how easy taking care of ourselves can be. %$* 0
there's no better way that you can show a patient that you care about them than by going the extra mile with them. %$* 0
there's no wait in the office. %$* 0
there's no fear of values. %$* 0
it's just the patient and the physician talking about whatever the patient wants to talk about. %$* 0
the beginning is to walk a mile or two. %$* 0
by the end of the year, i've completed a marathon. %$* 0
i'm thinking of signing up for a second marathon. %$* 0
doctor have a good talk to me. %$* 0
you can achieve things that are really big. %$* 0
but it all starts with small steps. %$* 0
how many miles do you have in already? %$* 1
two point seven. %$* 1
eighty percent of cardiac disease is preventable if we just go for a walk. %$* 0
people just take that first step. %$* 0
they will never look back. %$* 1
