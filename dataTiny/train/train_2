the gop in turmoil tonight amidst fears that donald trump could cost them the senate. %$* 0
this is cnn tonight. %$* 0
i'm don lemon. %$* 0
the candidate himself speaking to a raucous crowd in pennsylvania tonight, his third campaign stop of the day. %$* 1
a victory in november will be a victory for you, the american people, and that's what it is. %$* 0
i didn't need to do this. %$* 0
i didn't need to do this. %$* 1
meanwhile, hillary clinton takes a shot at trump today. %$* 1
i have now spent four and a half hours on stage with donald proving once again i have the stamina to be president and commander-in-chief. %$* 1
we'll get to all of that. %$* 0
meanwhile, we have some breaking news right now from the trump campaign, the candidate promising to announce his plan for the first 100 days of his presidency tomorrow. %$* 0
here to discuss all of this now is john phillips, kabc talk radio host and a trump supporter, and also symone sanders, former national press secretary for bernie sanders, gina loudon, a trump supporter and behavioral and psychology expert, and bakari sellers, cnn political commentator and a hillary clinton supporter. %$* 0
good evening to all of you. %$* 0
let's discuss this breaking news now, the first 100 days, john and gina, donald trump was on sean hannity's show tonight, let's listen. %$* 1
tomorrow you're going to make a pledge and put it on paper for the american people. %$* 0
you're doing it in gettysburg? %$* 1
right. %$* 1
give us a preview, what is this about? %$* 0
is this like a contract with america? %$* 1
sean, i want to do it tomorrow. %$* 0
i don't want do it right now. %$* 0
i really want to do it tomorrow. %$* 0
i can only say we're going to make america great again. %$* 0
we have so many problems. %$* 0
our taxes are too high. %$* 0
we're going to reduce them. %$* 0
our borders are weak. %$* 0
our regulations are crazy. %$* 0
drugs are pouring into our country. %$* 0
people are coming into the country that we really shouldn't have come into the country. %$* 0
we have drug lords and criminals and murderers. %$* 0
i mean, what's going on in this country is incredible. %$* 0
hillary wants open borders where people can just flow through. %$* 0
we're not going to have a country any more. %$* 0
we are going to do something very special and tomorrow i think is going to be a special day at a special place. %$* 1
so it's going to be in gettysburg. %$* 0
john, you first what can you tell me about this speech tomorrow? %$* 1
i'm told it is going to be modeled after the contract with america, and one of the things he's going to talk about is adding 350 warships to the navy. %$* 0
we, of course, saw the russians send a war ship off the coast of england today, which scared the brits, and they're rattling their sabers over there and they need somebody to counter balance them. %$* 0
our navy is depleted so that's going to be part of it. %$* 0
term limits which he's been speaking out about in recent weeks are going to be discussed in part of this plan and ethics reform, as well. %$* 1
ethics, ok. %$* 0
so gina, how -- we mentioned term limits and some of the things that he's been talking about. %$* 0
how is this going to be different than what he's said in the past? %$* 0
gina, what do you know? %$* 1
i think detailing a plan will reassure perhaps some republicans who maybe have some doubts about what his actions are going to be, just because he has progressed through his life from a different political perspective. %$* 0
and i think people want to know exactly where he is and exactly what he's going to do and i think him laying that out is a very smart tactic. %$* 0
those sorts of plans go over really well, especially with conservatives. %$* 0
it might lay some fears and give people some concern and optimism in a race that has gotten sort of pessimistic in a lot of ways. %$* 1
so he held a call tonight with reporters and so i'm just sort of looking over some of the things before i get to bakari and symone. %$* 0
appoint judges to uphold the constitution, he said that. %$* 0
change immigration rules to give unemployed americans an opportunity to feel good, real1y good, so some of that he's already said. %$* 0
stand up to countries that cheat on trade. %$* 0
and there are new things like adding warships and ethics reform and term limits as well, which he's spoken about. %$* 0
so bakari, he's laying out his first 100-day plan. %$* 0
to clinton supporters is this the ultimate hail mary? %$* 0
i mean, look at the poll numbers. %$* 1
i'm actually glad with less than three weeks remaining in the presidential race, donald trump decides that, my goodness, it's time to actually talk about policies so that's a bit ironic. %$* 0
i think what you just heard on his clip with hannity, which is a word salad, which donald has been known to do throughout this race. %$* 0
so i anticipate tomorrow to be much more of that. %$* 0
i'm interested to see whether or not we're going to be building a wall and banning muslims in our first hundred days and mention to see if some of these other asinine ideas he's had over the past year and a half will be part of his 100-day plan. %$* 1
symone, what are you looking for? %$* 1
again i'm shocked. %$* 0
i am not optimistic that we're going to see actual concrete policy. %$* 0
this is something new for donald trump's campaign. %$* 0
i'm just looking for some cold hard facts, something we haven't seen this entire general and even the primary election season from donald trump. %$* 1
ok, so he held three rallies today in two states. %$* 0
let listen. %$* 1
win, lose, or draw and i'm almost sure -- if the people come out, we're going to win, but i will be -- i will be happy with myself because i always say, i don't want to think back, if only i did one more rally, i would have won north carolina by 500 votes instead of losing it by 200 votes, right? %$* 0
if only i did. %$* 0
so i never want to ever look back. %$* 0
i never want to say that about myself. %$* 0
we have to work -- you have to get everybody you know out there. %$* 1
it seems like, john, a slightly more conciliatory tone coming from donald trump. %$* 0
what did you hear from donald trump? %$* 1
look, all those stops in southwest airlines, he's had more. %$* 0
you can't accuse the guy of being lazy. %$* 0
he's out there working the campaign trail about as hard as you possibly can, and look, if i have one major criticism of the campaign so far, is that's been so easy to get off message. %$* 0
if he could stay on message and just focus on five things he's going to do or ten things that he's going to do. %$* 0
he'd be in a much better place than he is now. %$* 0
it's the fourth quarter and he's down two touchdowns so he's got to put some more points on the board and that's what you're seeing him try to do with what he's going to do tomorrow in gettysburg. %$* 1
but symone, when did you ever heard trump say win, lose, or draw, in that tone where he's so -- he was really sort of laid back. %$* 0
usually we're going to win, we're going to win. %$* 0
we're going to win big league. %$* 0
don't you think there was more of a conciliatory tone for him? %$* 1
i definitely think it was conciliatory tone. %$* 0
i mean, look, this is the same man that has been casting doubt on this country's ability to run free and fair elections, a cornerstone of our democracy. %$* 0
so what you heard from donald trump is he is laying the groundwork for loss on november 8th, and i think he's understanding it, he's trying to get his people to understand it. %$* 0
look, i've been in the campaign and we're down in the polls, but you cannot go out there and not give it your all, so that' what donald trump is doing. %$* 0
he's like i want you to go out to the polls, get out there and we're going to win. %$* 0
win, lose, or draw -- win, lose or draw is code for we may be about to lose this thing. %$* 1
all right. %$* 1
so please help us. %$* 1
gina, do you want to weigh in on that? %$* 0
sounds like we're about to lose this thing, in desperation? %$* 1
you know, i have the worst urge right now to say, that's right, hillary voters, just stay home. %$* 0
it's all ok.  actually this is the guy that wrote the art of the comeback. %$* 0
he's up in the most accurate poll, which is the ibd. %$* 0
it's the most predictive, at least historically. %$* 0
he's up by one point there. %$* 0
he's up in the "l.a. times" daily tracking poll, so it depends on which poll you look at. %$* 0
i think mr. trump -- honestly, i believe this -- i think he likes exactly where he is right now in this race. %$* 0
i think he's having fun with it and he has every plan of winning. %$* 0
that's just how i see him and his personality -- %$* 1
bakari, i can read your mind. %$* 0
i know what you're saying. %$* 0
he didn't write it, somebody else wrote it. %$* 0
but anyway, am i lying, is that what you were thinking? %$* 0
go ahead. %$* 1
i was actually thinking about all of these polls that donald trump is up in. %$* 0
poll -- says who, polls? %$* 1
all of them. %$* 1
all of them. %$* 1
there are more than that. %$* 1
every poll. %$* 1
but i want to give donald trump a compliment, because john just pointed out something, and i was thinking about this earlier. %$* 0
one of the things that donald trump has shown is he's a candidate who is willing to work extremely hard on the campaign trail. %$* 0
we've seen him do rally, after rally, and state, after state. %$* 0
many times in the same day greeting hundreds and tens of thousands of people. %$* 0
i mean that's very tiring and taxing and for him to keep up this pace for you know a year and a half you have to give kudos. %$* 0
the problem, though, with the trump campaign is that they only have done this one aspect well. %$* 0
they've done the presentation during the rally well, but they haven't done the messaging, they haven't done the opposition research. %$* 0
they haven't done the opposition research on their own candidate. %$* 0
they haven't done the fundraising other than the small dollar fundraising. %$* 0
they got off to a fundraising start pretty late in the game. %$* 0
and they have absolutely no ground game. %$* 0
you have to give them kudos for the ability to do this in their endurance, but if they would have done this throughout every aspect of their campaign, it may have been a different race. %$* 1
i see john and gina agreeing with you wholeheartedly saying you're absolutely right, bakari. %$* 0
i'm kidding. %$* 0
we'll hear what they have to say on the other side of the break. %$* 0
don't go anywhere. %$* 0
one of donald trump's closest advisors in hot water, and new testimony in court today about new jersey governor chris christie's bridgegate scandal. %$* 0
here to discuss is cnn's brynn gingras. %$* 0
she joins us now with more on this. %$* 0
so brynn, today a key player in the bridgegate scandal broke her silence and talking about bridgette anne kelly. %$* 0
what did she say  stand? %$* 1
she's a top former aide. %$* 0
we all know her name is tied to the bridgegate scandal, on federal trial at this point, and she again is a former of christi aide and author of an e-mail that is a key piece of evidence in this whole scandal, again, that we know as bridgegate. %$* 0
and that e-mail read "time for some traffic problems" and today it was really the first time that we heard what kelly meant by those words as she took the stand in her own defense. %$* 0
she faces federal charges over the controversial lane closures of the george washington bridge back in 2013 which federal prosecutors argue caused major gridlock and were an act of political retribution by governor christie against the fourth league new jersey mayor who had yet to endorse christie in his bid for re-election. %$* 0
of course, christi continues to deny all of this in a press conference at that time, but also again today. %$* 0
he sent a statement and i want to read part of that to you. %$* 0
he said, "the governor has said since january 2014, the governor had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments and he had no role in authorizing them. %$* 0
anything said to the contrary is simply untrue. %$* 0
completely denying it. %$* 1
did she talk about his temperament on the stand? %$* 0
what did she say about it? %$* 1
you know, she did mention the fact that, you know, of course, this is his top aide so she dealt with him a lot and she did talk about when she approached him about this traffic study and said that he really didn't have much of a reaction. %$* 0
but she also on the stand brought up two other instances where she had a talk to christie about press conferences and other things that were going on and at one point, she says he cursed at her. %$* 0
her lawyer actually flat out asked her, were you afraid of governor christie and she said, yes. %$* 0
so she did talk a little bit about her dealings with the governor in cases unrelated to bridgegate, but certainly we did learn a little bit more there. %$* 1
it's a very interesting time for the trump campaign and for especially for chris christie, who is part of that. %$* 0
thank you very much, brynn, and thank you for coming on the show. %$* 0
really appreciate having you. %$* 0
back now with my panel, john phillips, symone sanders, gina loudon, and bakari sellers. %$* 0
so bakari, let's talk about governor chris christie, a key figure in the trump campaign. %$* 0
he was one of the first to endorse donald trump after the primary, and he's a chairman of the transition team. %$* 0
even played hillary clinton for trump's debate prep. %$* 0
we haven't seen him publicly with donald trump lately. %$* 0
are they distancing themselves from each other? %$* 1
i think they are. %$* 0
i mean, i think that chris christie has fallen greatly since 2012 when a lot of people thought he was the only challenger for the republican nomination to mitt romney. %$* 0
and then the irony is pretty thick in this because chris christie is the one who was prosecuting the case against hillary clinton at salem witch trials, also known as the republican national convention when he was chanting out "guilty, guilty, guilty." %$* 0
and now you see he has his own legal quagmire here that he has to deal with. %$* 0
chris christie is very, very talented. %$* 0
i don't think anyone doubts that. %$* 0
he's a shrewd prosecutor and lawyer and he would be an asset to donald trump over these last three weeks. %$* 0
with that being said, he hasn't taken care of home and i think that you've seen he's one of the worst governors in this last term of any governor in the united states, be them democrat or republican. %$* 1
john, do you agree with that? %$* 1
no, not at all. %$* 0
and in terms of the report that we just heard, have you ever met anyone from new jersey that doesn't drop the f-bomb every other word that's  very much par for the course -- %$* 1
yes, my producer's one of them and she's saying plenty of them in my ear right now but go on. %$* 1
chris christie's helpful as a closer in a presidential election before in the past, it just happened to be for barack obama last time around after hurricane sandy hit. %$* 0
look, new jersey is not in play. %$* 0
that's not a swing state. %$* 0
hillary clinton is going to win that state. %$* 0
that's not where donald trump is focusing his time or attention. %$* 0
he's focusing it obviously in the state of pennsylvania, north carolina and all the purple states that we've all been for the last few weeks. %$* 0
so i'm not surprised that chris christie isn't front and center. %$* 1
so you think what happens in november 8th, trump's surrogates will be fine and does that stand for governor christie, as well? %$* 1
well, look, chris christie represents a very blue state. %$* 0
he's termed out as governor. %$* 0
there's really probably no place for him to go, maybe a u.s. senate seat, but that's unlikely. %$* 0
he was at the last stop on the subway any way if he didn't win the republican primary -- %$* 1
i digress. %$* 1
tip your waitress. %$* 1
what about speaker paul ryan, who faced a lot of backlash for not defending or campaigning with donald trump? %$* 0
do you think he's going to be fine, john? %$* 0
phillips:  look, there's been a lot of discord within the republican party for some time now. %$* 0
if you go back to when bob michaels was taken out by newt gingrich for the very same reason. %$* 0
newt gingrich was taken out as the republican leader then you fast forward to john boehner, he was always dealing with these problems. %$* 0
if kevin mccarthy would have been elevated to speaker, he would had these problems. %$* 0
and now paul ryan is experiencing this. %$* 0
and the main reason is because republican benefactors have a very different idea of where the party should be politically than republican voters. %$* 0
and the way these people have been handling it through the years, republican leaders, is they've been saying one thing in their district and doing a different thing in washington, and is what you saw in this primary, in this republican primary is you saw voters saying we're over that. %$* 0
we're over you people saying one thing and doing a different thing in washington, d.c. and that's why donald trump was able to win the primary and i think that's going to be something that all of these leaders are  going to have to be cognizant of in the future. %$* 0
it's what us common folks, you know, refer to as talking out of both sides of your neck, right? %$* 1
exactly. %$* 0
vice president joe biden didn't hold back today, listen to this. %$* 1
if we let donald trump -- if we let donald trump somehow even get a significant -- a significant minority in the vote, it says things to the rest of the world about us that are dangerous. %$* 0
i've traveled over 1,200,000 miles as vice president of the united states. %$* 0
i go it because i go to meet with heads of state because when i speak to them, i speak for the president. %$* 0
i'm not the secretary of state, secretary of defense. %$* 0
they never have to wonder what i say is exactly what the president will do is because we have worked it out. %$* 0
and i have his confidence, and everywhere i go this is not hyperbole, everywhere i go, i get asked by world leaders, this can't be true, is it? %$* 1
so, there is a real push from democrats, bakari, for donald trump to lose in a landslide to send a message right so that he cannot question the outcome, as well. %$* 0
do you think the democrats can pull it off? %$* 1
i hope so and we're working damn hard to make sure that it's a mandate and the reason we're working so hard it's a mandate  is because this is not just beating donald trump, the man. %$* 0
this is abo beating racism, misogyny, xenophobia, bigotry. %$* 0
all of those elements that donald trump's campaign has embraced. %$* 0
so this isn't about beating donald trump's in the election november 8th of this year. %$* 0
this is about beating back all of those concepts that so many people have worked hard. %$* 0
and we thought were stamped out, but apparently it's still alive and very, very well. %$* 0
so i think that this election is more than just beating donald trump, the man who makes flippant comments, disrespectful comments, and asinine comments. %$* 0
this is about beating the mentality, every ism that is held back, handicapped, black people, hispanic people, women in this country for so long. %$* 0
so yes, we're going to work really hard to make sure that he feels this and everyone who has that same mind-set feels this as well. %$* 1
gina, you disagree. %$* 0
you don't think he's hit on all those topics that bakari said on xenophobia, racism, homophobia, and on and on? %$* 1
i mean, i've read a lot about those kinds of things in the podesta e-mails that came from hillary clinton and her staff, but i haven't really seen that from mr. trump. %$* 0
i think a lot of things have been twisted. %$* 0
the words out of his mouth have been twisted by the media or taken completely out of context to try to allude. %$* 0
that's the case. %$* 0
when i look at mr. trump's staff i look at katrina pierson, i could go down the list of people that mr. trump has elevated of all sorts of races. %$* 0
we know that mr. trump hires more women than he does -- %$* 1
you're referring more to his words and messaging than people he's paying -- %$* 0
let gina finish her thought and then i'll let you get in, symone. %$* 0
go ahead, gina. %$* 1
this is the difference, again, and again, between actions and words. %$* 0
we can construe mr. trump's words however you want to construe them, but his actions, and the fact that he unlike the clinton foundation, pays women more than he pays men -- %$* 1
because he doesn't have a political resume to draw on and so people are putting probably maybe a little bit more weight on his words because he doesn't have a history in politics so they're trying to figure out where he goes from what he says. %$* 0
go ahead, symone. %$* 1
that's out of context. %$* 1
no, i think -- words matter. %$* 0
donald trump is running for president of the united states, ok? %$* 0
so, his words are extremely important because as president, your words -- your words could -- we can talk about the fact he's african-americans, latinos in this country, muslims. %$* 0
loudon:  when? %$* 0
what discrimination? %$* 0
pardon me. %$* 0
are you talking about the fact that donald trump was sued -- %$* 1
what evidence do you have that he's ever attacked a woman? %$* 1
the sexual assault allegations from the -- the ten to 12 women -- %$* 1
those are allegations. %$* 0
that's not evidence. %$* 1
ok. %$* 0
this is -- wait, no, don. %$* 0
this is what i'll say -- %$* 1
that was bakari, not me, but go on. %$* 1
i'm itching to jump here, symone, tag me. %$* 1
i'm going to tag you, bakari. %$* 1
it's friday. %$* 0
sorry. %$* 0
go ahead. %$* 1
it is extremely important that donald trump has to answer for what it is that he said, but also what said that he's done and i'm sorry to name that donald trump has some women on staff and has some people of color on staff isn't enough. %$* 0
there are people with black friends that are racist. %$* 0
there are people with -- you know that are very close with women that have elevated women in their companies that are misogynistic, that are sexists. %$* 0
so we have to go with the fact and the fact that we've seen from donald trump is that he has spewed racist rhetoric and demonstrated that's his mentality and that's what's around him. %$* 1
let bakari -- %$* 1
thank you so much. %$* 0
because gina was asking one simple questions about actions and donald trump's actions and when has he discriminate? %$* 0
so i decided that we will recite a few facts about his actions. %$* 0
we can go back to his housing discrimination lawsuits in which he had to settle not one but two because he literally marked "c" on applications for colors and the central park five in which he took full page ads out asking for these -- %$* 1
donald trump had nothing do with that -- %$* 1
-- five young men who were actually innocent of this crime -- %$* 1
you said donald trump had nothing to do with taking out ads in the newspapers on the central park five? %$* 1
it was not donald trump himself -- sellers:  i actually want to use the words of the speaker of the house %$* 0
and paul ryan who said it was textbook racism when donald trump said that judge curiel could simply not rule in the case because of his mexican heritage and he's from illinois, so -- indiana, excuse me. %$* 0
so to say there are no actions to match up with the things i was talking about, to actually mock a disabled reporter, yes, those are actions. %$* 0
he did not do that and the proof is out there he did not do that. %$* 1
and you wanted to list -- %$* 1
wait, wait. %$* 1
you wanted to list the number of black people who have senior positions on donald trump's campaign? %$* 0
you name katrina pierson. %$* 0
i bet you can't name two. %$* 1
i could go on all day, amorosa. %$* 0
i'm not going to play into your little tester -- %$* 1
wait, name a third? %$* 0
who is the third? %$* 0
amorosa and katrina are the only two black people -- %$* 1
people in the studio are even laughing. %$* 0
listen, i've got to get back to gina. %$* 0
it is important -- it is important facts do matter and you're saying donald trump is not responsible for taking an ad out. %$* 1
they do. %$* 1
and he didn't discriminate -- %$* 1
how do you answer for hillary clinton saying that they have names in their back pocket -- %$* 1
that's a great pivot but i need to be factual here. %$* 0
you just can't spit out to the audience those things are not true. %$* 1
there's zero evidence about the so-called misogyny of mr. trump. %$* 0
there is zero evidence. %$* 0
there are a lot -- %$* 1
we've got him on tape saying grab them by the vagina. %$* 0
what do you mean? %$* 1
do we have the bus video that we can play? %$* 1
you've seen that? %$* 0
what about ms. clinton and the fact that she defended a child rapist and actually blamed the victim, the 12- year-old child? %$* 1
this is what this is. %$* 0
we've got 19 days to election day. %$* 0
donald trump is flailing in the polls. %$* 1
ok, guys, it's been a long week. %$* 0
standby, we're going to reset. %$* 0
we'll be right back. %$* 0
ok.  we're back now with my very interesting panel. %$* 0
so we were talking about donald trump and misogyny and all those things. %$* 0
let's just play this. %$* 1
i better use some tic tacs, just in case i start kissing her. %$* 0
you know, i'm automatically attracted to beautiful. %$* 0
i just start kissing them. %$* 0
it's like a magnet. %$* 0
i just kiss. %$* 0
i don't even wait. %$* 0
and when you're a star, they let you do it. %$* 0
you can do anything. %$* 1
whatever you want. %$* 1
grab them by the pussy. %$* 0
you can do anything. %$* 1
so that's not misogyny, you know, insinuating that ted cruz's wife is not attractive on this show, saying, you know, megyn kelly had blood coming out of her wherever. %$* 0
then you've got the central park five ad and i'm at a sign. %$* 0
it says, donald j. trump -- you know, here's the ad for the central park five. %$* 0
you said, gina, he didn't take this ad out, but there it is. %$* 0
so how you can say these things and then say it's not true, that none of it happened. %$* 0
i mean, you don't think that that's misogyny, what happened on the bus? %$* 0
talking about rosie o'donnell, calling her a pig, that's not misogyny? %$* 0
that's not evidence. %$* 1
i think misogyny is when you take hundreds of millions of dollars from the government that stone women to death and throw gay people off of buildings, to me, that's some of the scariest kind of corruption i have ever heard of. %$* 0
i think misogyny is where you blame the rape victim -- %$* 1
that's -- %$* 1
-- like hillary clinton did -- %$* 1
but that's -- %$* 1
-- and that's on tape. %$* 1
that's absurd. %$* 1
i think -- %$* 1
that is absurd. %$* 1
-- misogyny is when you -- %$* 1
that's absurd and that's a disservice. %$* 0
loudon:  i think misogyny is when you spend $100,000 to try to destroy %$* 0
and defame women who have been sexual assaulted, and it's been proven, by your husband. %$* 1
no. %$* 1
see, those things are -- %$* 1
no, no, no, no. %$* 1
-- the things that i, as a woman -- %$* 1
no. %$* 0
no. %$* 1
that's not misogyny and that's doing -- %$* 1
-- i cannot exploit that. %$* 1
that's doing a disservice -- %$* 1
ok, bakari, go ahead. %$* 1
that's misogyny. %$* 1
go ahead, bakari. %$* 1
no, no, no. %$* 0
that's doing a disservice to every woman who goes out here and makes 70 cents on the dollar for every man. %$* 0
what misogyny is what donald trump talked about on that bus because we all have -- %$* 1
hillary clinton pays men -- %$* 1
we all have daughters, we all have -- %$* 1
-- $80,000 more than women. %$* 1
let him finish. %$* 1
-- we all have mothers, we all have sisters, and to say you're going to sexual assault someone like that and simply do it because you're famous, that is misogyny. %$* 0
the way -- %$* 1
but he didn't do it. %$* 1
-- that he talks about woman, the way that he treats women -- %$* 1
and he apologized. %$* 1
-- with such disrespect -- because he apologized for sexual assault? %$* 0
and now you nine, 10, 11 women who come out and say that he did the same thing to them -- %$* 1
he didn't sexually assault anyone. %$* 0
that's -- lemon:  ok. %$* 0
there's no proof of that. %$* 1
-- they say they did the same thing to them, i mean, the definition that you just gave about misogyny or for misogyny is truly a disservice to women around the country. %$* 0
and i'm sorry to say that, but that is the definition of ask a man . %$* 1
no, it's a disservice to women -- it's a disservice to women when there are multiple, unproven, most of them completely unfounded accusations that -- %$* 1
how are they unfounded? %$* 1
who are you to say they're unfounded? %$* 1
when women -- %$* 1
he said it. %$* 1
you are -- %$* 1
when women are -- %$* 1
he said it. %$* 1
when women are truly assaulted -- %$* 1
he said it. %$* 1
when you -- %$* 1
but he said it. %$* 1
when you parade these women and exploit them for campaign purposes just like this -- %$* 1
the only person that paraded women and exploited for campaign purposes was donald trump. %$* 1
-- women who are actually sexually assaulted. %$* 1
when he rolled out the accusers of former president bill clinton prior to the second debate, he's the only person that's exploited people for political gain in this situation. %$* 0
look, here's the problem. %$* 0
here is -- %$* 1
this isn't about bill clinton. %$* 0
this is about what hillary -- %$* 1
here is -- %$* 1
this isn't about bill clinton. %$* 1
you should probably talk to your candidate. %$* 0
here are the facts and here's the issue here. %$* 0
it is perfectly ok -- %$* 1
no, it's about what hillary clinton did to the women that her husband assaulted. %$* 1
you're going to let me finish. %$* 0
here is the issue here. %$* 0
it is perfectly ok to admit that, you know, your candidate has done something wrong, that your candidate has some shortcomings, that there are some things that your candidate can improve on. %$* 0
i am supporting hillary clinton and i do it all the time. %$* 0
you know, people are human. %$* 0
but it is not ok to make excuses, to blatantly lie to distort the facts, that does no one a good service. %$* 0
look, donald trump has -- %$* 1
we agree. %$* 1
-- has been -- so i would hope that you're not going to continue to distort the definition of misogyny and that you would get back to the facts. %$* 0
and the facts here are that donald trump is on record -- %$* 1
it is fact. %$* 1
-- bragging about sexually assaulting women. %$* 0
he is bragging about the fact that he can do anything he likes -- %$* 1
i hated that -- %$* 1
-- because he is a person of means, ok? %$* 1
i hated that as much as you hated that and i think he did, too. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 1
ok. %$* 1
and he apologized for it. %$* 0
but there's -- %$* 1
so i just want to put down that hillary clinton -- %$* 1
you know, don -- %$* 1
but there is no evidence of anything ever happening. %$* 1
yes, john, this is an interesting conversation that we're both watching here. %$* 1
yes. %$* 1
go ahead. %$* 1
yes. %$* 0
well, after this heated discussion, i feel the need that we should find some common ground and kind of smooth things out here. %$* 0
bakari said earlier that hillary clinton is working to get rid of all %$* 0
of the "isms" on the world, and on that point, he and i are in complete agreement. %$* 0
we've got individualism, capitalism, counter terrorism, which is why, even though she's in the lead nationally, she's still one of the most unpopular candidates to ever run for the presidency. %$* 0
that remains true. %$* 0
so even though, you know, we're seeing her in the lead in these swing state polls and in national polls, she's going to have a lot of problems if she were to be elected that are going to present themselves in january. %$* 1
i have to give a pivoting for the surrogates. %$* 0
i have to give both of you a 10 tonight for doing that, a perfect score, especially when gina said -- you know, when i asked her a question about donald trump, she immediately pivoted to hillary clinton, but then when symone brought up something, she said this is not about bill clinton. %$* 0
so, i mean, props to both of you for your pivoting efforts this evening. %$* 0
joe biden, earlier today. %$* 0
let's listen. %$* 1
i have not wanted to get into, if you've noticed in the national press, talking about trump's behavior, his personal behavior. %$* 0
but what he said he did and does is a textbook definition of sexual assault. %$* 0
and think -- %$* 0
no, no. %$* 0
think about this. %$* 0
but it's more than that. %$* 0
he said, because i'm famous, because i'm a star, because i'm a billionaire, i can do things other people can't. %$* 0
what a disgusting assertion for anyone to make. %$* 0
the press always asks me, don't i wish i were debating him? %$* 0
no, i wish we're in high school and i could take him behind the gym, that's what i wish. %$* 1
so kellyanne conway, trump's campaign manager, tweeted after this biden rally that, "had trump said this, it would be hair-on-fire, breaking news, with 'violence' and 'bully' trending, high school psychologists on t.v. %$* 0
panels." %$* 0
does she have a point, symone? %$* 1
look, i don't think anyone should be suggesting violence to anyone, so -- look, i'm not going to agree with kellyanne conway on that. %$* 0
i think she's being extreme because donald trump has actually talked about people who believe in the second amendment to take up -- everyone believes in the second amendment, for that matter -- for people who are second amendment activists to take up arms against hillary clinton. %$* 0
he suggested that secret service shouldn't protect her for a short period of time to see what happens. %$* 0
so he has directly threatened violence against the secretary. %$* 1
i'm human, though, don. %$* 1
and i don't think we should -- %$* 1
that was a good pivot, too, symone, but go ahead. %$* 1
-- be complacent to it. %$* 1
no, i'm human, though, don -- %$* 1
go ahead. %$* 1
-- and so i can say actually that, a lot of those things -- and this isn't just political talk. %$* 0
but you talk about the way that we're having a serious discussion about the value of women in this country, i mean, i don't know, i mean, if you talked about it earlier today, but you have, you know, john brown, who was the kicker for the new york giants, who just -- %$* 1
you got 20 seconds, bakari. %$* 0
go ahead. %$* 1
-- stated that he was abusing his wife and then the nfl did nothing, and you have donald trump who makes it ok, who normalizes this behavior, condescending and misogyny and sexual assault. %$* 0
i mean, yes, i mean, there are a lot of people who want to take donald trump behind the gym and i concur with joe biden. %$* 0
i'm one of them. %$* 1
fascinating panel. %$* 0
thank you very much guy. %$* 0
have a great weekend. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 1
when we come right back, celebrities and activists tell donald trump his treatment of women is not ok. %$* 0
donald trump's crude "access hollywood" tape bragging about his treatment of women shocked people all across the country, across the world really, and prompted celebrities to join survivors of sexual assault in a new video titled, "not ok," and released by the group, humanity for hillary. %$* 0
take a look. %$* 1
women respond to #trumtapes %$* 1
when i was 15. %$* 0
when i was 12. %$* 1
i moved in her like a bitch. %$* 1
when i he was 13 years old. %$* 0
when i was 23. %$* 1
grab them by the . %$* 1
when i was 15. %$* 0
when i was 29. %$* 1
when you're a star, they let you do it. %$* 0
you can do anything. %$* 1
when i was 19. %$* 1
when i was 14 years old. %$* 1
this was locker room talk. %$* 1
on my second day of my freshman year of college, i was raped and the mediator found him to be innocent, which meant that they didn't believe me. %$* 0
what are we supposed to do, you know? %$* 0
like, you're talking about harassing us like that's ok. %$* 1
not ok. %$* 1
it's not ok. %$* 1
it's not ok. %$* 0
not ok. %$* 0
it's not ok. %$* 0
not ok. %$* 0
it's not ok. %$* 0
not ok. %$* 0
not ok. %$* 0
not ok. %$* 0
not ok. %$* 0
not ok. %$* 1
it's not ok. %$* 0
seriously. %$* 1
yes. %$* 0
seriously, it's not ok. %$* 0
joining me now is rosie perez who appears in humanity for hillary's "not ok" video, and liz garbus, the director of that video. %$* 0
hello, ladies. %$* 0
thank you for joining us. %$* 0
how are you doing? %$* 1
very well. %$* 0
thanks for having us. %$* 1
well, thank you for coming on. %$* 0
so -- %$* 1
yes, thank you. %$* 1
yes. %$* 0
liz, i want to ask you first about this campaign and what prompted you to make this video. %$* 1
well, i guess it was the weekend after the friday that those trump tapes were released, and i had just so much anxiety and upsetness. %$* 0
and all of us were talking and all women know what it feels like to be on the other side of that language. %$* 0
many, many women know what it feels like to be groped or, worse, raped, assaulted. %$* 0
and so i wanted to give those women a voice. %$* 0
so it was like sunday of that weekend and we started putting it together. %$* 0
and i'll tell you, what's really sad is, it was not hard to find sexual assault survivors who wanted to come forward and tell their stories. %$* 0
we can't have a person representing our country who thinks that language which is, at best harassing and at worse advocating sexual violence, is something that can be dismissed as casual conversation or something that's worth a chuckle. %$* 1
yes. %$* 0
i would imagine it wasn't hard to get people involved when you look at the caliber of celebrities who are in there including rosie perez. %$* 0
and, rosie, i have to ask you, how did you hear about this and was it hard for you to say yes? %$* 1
it wasn't hard for me to say yes at all. %$* 0
i was on my way to nova scotia to film and i got a text from liz garbus that says, would you do this? %$* 0
i didn't even text back, "yes." %$* 0
i just filmed myself saying, "not ok," and sent it off to her. %$* 0
what i appreciate most about the film is how -- the diversity in age and the diversity in nationalities and ethnicities of these women, you know. %$* 0
and it's very, very poignant, you know. %$* 0
it's not an issue that is relegated to a certain group. %$* 0
it's happening to all women, young and old. %$* 1
rosie, when you heard that conversation on that bus between donald trump and billy bush, what did you think? %$* 1
well, it just confirmed my suspicions about who donald trump is as a person. %$* 0
he's just not a man of good character, and that tape proves it. %$* 0
and it was so assaulting to me that i looked at my husband and i gasped, and i said, oh, no, oh no. %$* 0
and what added insult to injury is that when the women came forward and said, wait a minute, he has done this to me, and he, you know, said, oh, they're all lying, they just want publicity. %$* 0
why didn't they come forward ahead of time? %$* 0
i've heard women on your show -- i watch your show -- in defense of donald trump saying, well, why didn't they tell their story before? %$* 0
listen, liz knows this, i wrote a book, you know. %$* 0
i didn't tell my story of being sexually harassed and sexual assaulted for 30 years. %$* 0
it took me 30 years to admit it, you know. %$* 0
and for these women to come forward, we should be supporting them and applauding them for their courage, you know, because with donald trump, if you stand up against him, he comes on the attack -- %$* 1
yes. %$* 1
-- and that's very scary. %$* 0
and for them to have the courage to stand up and say something is extraordinary. %$* 1
well, speaking of what she's talking about, liz, i have to ask you because donald trump has said that this was locker room talk. %$* 0
that's his words. %$* 0
his wife, melania, told anderson here on cnn that it was just boy talk. %$* 0
what do you make of that explanation? %$* 1
i think women know the connection between words and actions. %$* 0
i mean, there's two answers to that. %$* 0
one is we have women saying he's done this exact thing to them, so there are the actions. %$* 0
the other things, if we want to say it's talk and it's boys talk and it's locker room talk, well, what words create an environment where actions are permissible? %$* 0
you know, someone told me the story of their daughter who's 10 years old, the boy grabbed her butt while she was taking a drink of water. %$* 0
the mother says, oh, that's just the way he's showing he likes you. %$* 0
no, that is violating a little girl's body and she goes home and feels sad about it. %$* 0
so we all know that if we say it's just talk or its' just the way boys do, then they can grow up and do much more aggressive things that make women feel unsafe in their own bodies. %$* 0
so the connection between talk and action is very clear. %$* 1
i want to play the -- %$* 1
and by the way -- %$* 1
go ahead. %$* 1
yes. %$* 1
go ahead, liz. %$* 1
i want to say that this is not -- you know, there's been an outcry about these trump cases, but trump has been using hate speech and hate language from the beginning of this campaign directed towards immigrants, people of color. %$* 0
and so, you know, this misogynist language which, you know, frankly, we all knew there was something that was going to come because of the way he's talked about women, rating them and degrading them, and allegations even from, you know, an ex-wife of assault. %$* 0
i mean, we knew this was coming, but it's in a continuum of hate speech that has been spattered throughout the entire campaign. %$* 1
i want to play this moment from the debate the other night. %$* 0
listen. %$* 1
my social security payroll contribution will go up, as will donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it. %$* 0
but what we want to do is to replenish the social security -- %$* 1
such a nasty woman. %$* 1
-- trust fund -- %$* 1
liz, does this go with what you are saying? %$* 1
yes. %$* 0
i mean, you know, i understand she feels he's pissing her, she knows how to bait him and stuff, but the nasty woman thing. %$* 0
i mean, i heard a quote earlier today of somebody saying, oh, you know, that we're -- somehow, you know, the media and the democrats are going to pull that old hag across the finish line to this election. %$* 0
you know, the language that's being used to describe people of accomplishment. %$* 0
and, you know, this infects our children. %$* 0
this infects the way that they talk in school, the way other children behave to each other. %$* 0
this is no example to set. %$* 0
you know, racism and misogyny are taught. %$* 0
you're not born this way. %$* 1
yes. %$* 1
so if you have someone who's in a position to lead our country, this is just not acceptable. %$* 0
it's not ok. %$* 1
rosie, i'll give you the last word. %$* 0
what did you think of this and what do you want people to get from this video? %$* 1
i want people to understand that if they can do it to someone like hillary clinton, they can do it to anybody. %$* 0
and they have been doing it. %$* 0
it's not just donald trump. %$* 0
if you look on social media, the attack and the assault on women on social media, specifically millenials and young kids, young girls, calling them sluts and whores and that you should be raped and "shut up, you stupid bitch," all of this is happening now. %$* 0
and now, the best thing that donald trump did by calling hillary clinton a nasty woman and being exposed on that tape, on that bus, it is galvanizing women, it is sparking women to stand up and say it is not ok, we're not going to take it, and the culture needs to be changed. %$* 1
rosie perez, liz garbus, thank you so much. %$* 1
thank you, don. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 0
we'll be right back. %$* 0
car accidents are the leading cause of death among teens in the united states more than cancer and homicides combined. %$* 0
this week's cnn hero is battling that shocking statistic, teaching kids how to properly handle themselves on the road and everyday emergency situations. %$* 0
meet jeff pain. %$* 1
a lot of parents would never toss their kid a loaded gun and tell them to have fun, but many of them just don't think twice about throwing them the car keys. %$* 0
we just throw the kids out there on the road and expect them to be prepared to handle every situation. %$* 0
and that's just not the case. %$* 0
we're just doing our job so we can make a difference out there and make the roads safer for all of us. %$* 1
to see the extreme driving situations jeff has put thousands of kids through, go to cnnheroes.com. %$* 0
and meet the top 10 cnn heroes of 2016 when anderson cooper introduces them. %$* 0
that's on wednesday, october 26th, on "new day." %$* 0
that's it for us. %$* 0
thanks for watching. %$* 1
