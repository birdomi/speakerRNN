{"sentences": [{"sentId": 118, "text": "Right."}, {"sentId": 119, "text": "So we heard Dan talk about the fact that he idolized other mass shooters and in this blog post, he talked about one in particular and that's Vester Flanagan, who was the shooter recently several weeks ago who shot a reporter and her photographer."}, {"sentId": 120, "text": "He says, \"I have noticed that so many

and if so, he shot and killed them."}, {"sentId": 131, "text": "What's interesting to note here Don though is that he hasn't talked about being an anti-Christian or anything like that in those writings that he passed over."}, {"sentId": 132, "text": "The only thing that eluded to that is on a social media page believed to belong to him."}, {"sentId": 133, "text": "He wrote that he disliked organized religion."}, {"sentId": 134, "text": "But as far as we can tell so far in this investigation, that's all he has put out there to elude to the fact that he had something against
