scenarios, the likes of which she hasn't seen."}, {"sentId": 70, "text": "The risks, of course, and this is what so many people who have watched her for years are saying, is that she can get sometimes too far into the weeds, that she needs to instead speak to voters and their concerns and convince them that she is the one who is able to do the job that they want done, without sort of getting into

of things; one, we heard from the executive director of the Commission on Presidential Debates that is actually staging this, and he basically said that it's really not the moderator's role, so to speak, that it really should be done between the two candidates whose also heard from former moderators as well, who had said that they don't think that, that is the role necessarily of the moderator."}, {"sentId": 75, "text": "But to your point, I mean, I do think that it puts all of these moderators in a very difficult position."}, {"sentId": 76, "text": "You're basically telling them

the truth, while there may not be real-time fact-checking on that stage, we'll see what happens with Lester Holt, who's moderating it, you will see real-time fact-checking on social media, you will see real-time fact-checking in certainly post fact-checking by the media, and that is going to, you know, carry some weight."}, {"sentId": 79, "text": "So, I don't think that it's going to be totally

that no matter how many times we go out and say that, you know, what Donald Trump said is not actually accurate, you become attacked."}, {"sentId": 90, "text": "In folks, interestingly enough, going into this debate, too, there seems to be this whole idea that, you know, it doesn't necessarily matter what the facts are."}, {"sentId": 91, "text": "We like Donald Trump and he's going to change

one-liner."}, {"sentId": 103, "text": "But the other thing that they understand, is they understand that you're going to be on a split screen for this."}, {"sentId": 104, "text": "This is one of the things that helps sink President Obama in that first debate in 2012."}, {"sentId": 105, "text": "It was a split screen of him looking like he was disengaged, he was annoyed to be there, up against Romney."}, {"sentId": 106, "text": "Ultimately, it did not matter, obviously, President Obama won re-election."}, {"sentId": 107, "text": "But I think that Roger Ailes knows very much what this looks like on television, what they sounds like on television."}, {"sentId": 108, "text": "Remember, Donald Trump made a lot of faces, he made a lot of hand gestures in those Republican Primary Debates, and I think that that's all part of what Roger Ailes brings to the table."}, {"sentId": 109, "text": "It's not just messaging, it's not just trying to bring something that will appeal, not only to Republicans but independents, but it's also, what is it going to look like on television?"}, {"sentId": 110, "text": "This is a television event, and I think that that is part of what Roger Ailes really brings to the table."}, {"sentId": 111, "text": "Now, we will see whether Donald Trump really practices these one-liners ahead of time, or whether he's quick on his feet."}, {"sentId": 112,

that he doesn't appear to be some an entirely different person than we have known him throughout the cycle."}, {"sentId": 123, "text": "Because what we do know, is that a lot of people may not have paid attention much up until now, and that there's going to be millions upon millions of viewers."}, {"sentId": 124, "text": "And then about a third of them are saying, this performance tomorrow night, this debate, is going to be consequential in who they decide to vote for in November."}, {"sentId": 125, "text": "So, I think it's something that she's trying to figure out a way, that she can control that, and make sure it doesn't happen."}, {"sentId": 126, "text": "I think the campaign is worried, too, though, that if he does come appearing more presidential, that that is going to be
