distance here and this line of marchers has come by steadily for the last few minutes."}, {"sentId": 139, "text": "But if you look one block off that way you can see where police officers have cordoned off the traffic not letting them come through this particular intersection."}, {"sentId": 140, "text": "And then if we turn back around this way you can also see that they have done a similar thing here."}], "speaker": "LAVANDERA", "secId": 42}, {"sentences": [{"sentId": 141, "text": "And we have seen officers moving throughout the downtown streets like this as following the crowd and kind

downtown streets."}], "speaker": "LAVANDERA", "secId": 43}, {"sentences": [{"sentId": 143, "text": "But, you know, we are now past the curfew time and there have been no calls of telling people about the curfew or urging them to go home at this point."}, {"sentId": 144, "text": "So we'll have to see exactly what the game plan will be here for the officers on the streets exactly how they're going to enforce the curfew and what that will entail."}], "speaker": "LAVANDERA", "secId": 44}, {"sentences": [{"sentId": 145, "text": "So they're going the keep moving around and as we talk to -- several hours ago that the officers seemed content as people were moving."}, {"sentId": 146, "text": "But now that we are past the curfew I have not really seen any officers engaging with this line of

taking place -- Don, is that they are not going to provoke anything."}, {"sentId": 159, "text": "They are peaceful."}, {"sentId": 160, "text": "And here shortly they're probably going the break up

set."}, {"sentId": 163, "text": "But there's really no need to engage unnecessarily if they are peaceful at this point."}, {"sentId": 164, "text": "But maybe it's a good thing that they put it in place."}, {"sentId": 165, "text": "A lot of people did leave but I think what they're going to have to do tomorrow night is make sure that they get the message out that at midnight the curfew comes
