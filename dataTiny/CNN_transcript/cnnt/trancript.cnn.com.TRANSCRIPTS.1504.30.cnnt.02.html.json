think it becomes critically important as well too, the flip side of that is that for years the police departments have done their own homicide investigations as it relates to fatalities and they have done a great job as well too."}, {"sentId": 126, "text": "But we are in a different era of policing today, and we had a very different time in policing as well to, which means now we have to move
