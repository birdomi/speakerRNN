-- tonight. %$* 0
this is cnn tonight. %$* 0
i'm don lemon. %$* 0
it's all about this bombshell, trump caught on tape in 2005, bragging to billy bush, at that time, a host of "access hollywood," about his treatment of women, his language, raw, obscene, and repugnant. %$* 0
we're going to get to our panel tonight. %$* 0
i want to start with cnn's dana bash, mark preston, brian stelter, david swerdlick, and also kevin madden, and rebecca byrd. %$* 0
dana, i need to start with you. %$* 0
what do we know about this video statement that trump has apparently made? %$* 1
not much except the fact that he did -- did make a statement that campaign intends to release fairly soon, this is according to a source familiar with this. %$* 0
presumably it will be released on some form of social media, either on twitter or instagram or facebook, and so you know we'll see what he says. %$* 0
the fact that he decided to go this route and tape his own statement without never mind a reporter there, but even a television network camera crew or any kind of journalistic camera crew, is quite telling how much they feel that they need to try to control the message about how he's going to respond to this. %$* 0
and you know we thought maybe he was going to try to control the damage before the debate on sunday. %$* 0
we weren't sure how he was going to do that. %$* 0
the fact that it is now 11:00 eastern, started to think maybe it's not going to happen, but again, i am told that there is a taped statement from donald trump coming soon. %$* 1
so again, a taped statement we're awaiting as you there at the bottom of your screen, a taped statement from donald trump on this latest controversy surrounding the comments that he made back in 2005 on "access hollywood." %$* 0
again, as i said, my panel is here. %$* 0
mr. mark preston, let's get to you, 32 days until election day. %$* 0
what does this stunning development mean at this point in the race? %$* 1
look, i can't imagine that donald trump right now, don, can survive this. %$* 0
when i say survive this, i mean, that he needed to excite voters. %$* 0
he needed to get people to want to come out and vote for him. %$* 0
these comments right now have really cause an enormous setback for him, not only with women voters, because women voters were offended by what he said, but we're talking about men, we're talking about fathers, grandfathers who have granddaughters and daughters and sisters and wives and mothers. %$* 0
and they hear these very crude comments and it's very hard i think for them to get over that. %$* 0
you know, this comes at a time, too, don, where the republican party, you know, was trying to coalesce behind donald trump. %$* 0
he was never able to get everybody to come together. %$* 0
we've seen statement, after statement, after statement, from republican leaders condemning donald trump for these remarks. %$* 0
now, a lot of these folks didn't like donald trump from the very beginning, but some of them were like mitch mcconnell. %$* 0
he's the republican leader in the senate. %$* 0
he's criticized donald trump for these remarks. %$* 0
paul ryan, who was going to stand with him on stage in wisconsin, in a deal that was brokered by reince priebus, to go up there and have a bit of a unity meeting, he's not going to be standing next to paul ryan anymore. %$* 0
paul ryan doesn't want him there and you got to understand why. %$* 0
it was just about six, seven hours ago where paul ryan was heralding this new law that was passed, this bipartisan law that was passed to help the survivors of sexual abuse and then this hits. %$* 0
it's just not a good place right now for republicans who are looking at the top of the ticket and they fear it is going to be a ripple effect and hurt republicans running for senate, and the house and congress, as well as state legislative races, don. %$* 1
all right, kevin madden, i always appreciate having you here. %$* 0
always a straight shooter. %$* 0
what could donald trump say in this video statement that we're awaiting that can save him or turn this around? %$* 1
boy, it's going to be tough. %$* 0
i think the most important thing for donald trump is to offer a very sincere, very remorseful message, and that's really the only thing that's going to get him out of this tail spin. %$* 0
and one of the big challenges that he's going to have is trying to sound sincere and remorseful in a taped video statement. %$* 0
we are now six, seven hours into this crisis, which is a lifetime when you're in the middle of a crisis like this. %$* 0
and we still don't have any messages to compete other than a written statement that was released earlier, and it just -- it's not enough right now. %$* 0
you're seeing one statement after the other come out from republican leaders. %$* 0
that is probably emblematic of the depressive affect this is probably having on republican voters around the country right now. %$* 0
so it is going to be very challenging for donald trump to achieve what he needs to achieve in a taped video statement. %$* 1
yes, rebecca, i'll ask you the same thing. %$* 0
do you think that there's anything that he could say to help? %$* 1
well, i agree with kevin completely that to come out and be contrite would go a long way for donald trump. %$* 0
he hasn't offered an apology really at any point in this campaign when he has faced these controversies, when he had faced this sort of scrutiny, for controversial remarks he's said in the present or the past. %$* 0
so for him to actually take that stuff and sincerely apologize, would go a long way, but the fact remains that he has made these statements and the damage is done. %$* 0
this video will be replayed on a loop over and over. %$* 0
and so donald trump will need to find a way and maybe the debate will present this sort of opportunity for him to move the conversation in another direction and to show people that there are other considerations that they should be making when they're considering their choice for president besides the way he treats women. %$* 0
and that's going to be very difficult for him because now this has really cemented a narrative that hillary clinton and democrats have worked very hard to cement among voters and especially as mark mentioned among suburban, white-collar, college-educated families who are really going to decide this election. %$* 0
this is an issue that can drive opinion and decide -- help them decide that donald trump is not someone they could possibly support. %$* 0
he's just beyond the pale. %$* 0
he needs to target those families and convince them that he's not beyond the pale, that they can support him. %$* 1
brian, let me ask you this. %$* 0
considering the media fall out of this because i mean, this is a big story. %$* 0
we're waiting live at trump tower. %$* 1
yes. %$* 1
we're waiting this coming out on video. %$* 0
the reason they're putting it on video is because they want to release this to the media. %$* 1
for sure. %$* 1
can apology -- can the -- is this the political equivalent of shooting someone on fifth avenue and can an apology take care of that? %$* 1
i disagree with rebecca. %$* 0
i don't think you can be contrite. %$* 0
i don't think you can be sincere. %$* 0
i don't think that will be effective. %$* 0
this is a man who has been quoted talking about stuff like this for 30-plus years. %$* 0
an apology for one single tape is not going to move the needle. %$* 0
there are other tapes. %$* 0
not necessarily in the "access hollywood" archives, but at "the apprentice" archives, you know, "the apprentice" is a reality show for over a decade. %$* 0
what triggered this tape coming out today, don, was an "associated press" story on monday. %$* 0
this is a story quoting former employees talking about how trump made sexist, lewd remarks on the set, behind the scenes, then "access hollywood" went looking for this tape. %$* 0
the ap story has graphic details. %$* 0
trump being quoted allegedly saying i'd like to hit that, talking about one of the women on set, talking about the nice rear end of one of the camera women, talking about having one of the women twirl for him, sounds a lot like roger ailes, the allegations against roger ailes, one of trump's longtime friends. %$* 0
on monday, let me read to you part of the trump campaign's denial. %$* 0
ailes is now an advisor of trump. %$* 0
let me read part of the denial. %$* 0
"these outlandish, unsubstantiated, and totally false claims fabricated by publicity hungry, opportunistic, disgruntled former employees, have no merit whatsoever." %$* 0
that's from the campaign spokesperson on monday. %$* 1
the initial story. %$* 0
not this one. %$* 1
right, this is the ap story on monday with employees quoted on the record, talking about what trump was saying on set, talking about sexist, lewd behavior. %$* 0
if they deny it on monday and on friday there's tape where some of these comments are recorded, how are people supposed to believe this denial for monday and how are people supposed to believe an apology that might come tonight if there's other tapes, if there's other lawsuits, if there's all this  accumulated evidence in the past? %$* 0
i just don't know how any apology, no matter how sincere, and let's be honest, he's fantastic on television. %$* 0
he knows how to play to the camera. %$* 0
i don't know how any apology can move the needle for him. %$* 1
dana bash, this is a statement from the rnc chair reince priebus, he says, "no woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner ever." %$* 0
dana, there is no pivot to hillary clinton here. %$* 0
there is no -- you know, being reflexive about bill clinton right away, no talking points, straight forward as it comes without saying, you know, i denounce my support. %$* 0
what's your reaction? %$* 1
not just that. %$* 0
our viewers are also probably should know that reince priebus is saying that very bluntly publicly and privately. %$* 0
he has been and continues to be one of the key players trying to help right the ship even now, along with the new jersey governor, chris christie, and others started out today with debate prep for sunday. %$* 0
and it was supposed to be today and then tomorrow was supposed to big unity event at wisconsin, ironically, an annual event that reince priebus, who is from wisconsin, and was a local official there, started many, many years ago. %$* 0
all of that was scrapped as we've been reporting, but reince priebus, the rnc chair, who is now just locked arm and arm with donald trump. %$* 0
really doesn't feel he doesn't have a choice, is trying to do his best to help with damage control at trump tower right now. %$* 1
kevin, you also have kathy mcmorris rodgers out there as the chair of the house gop. %$* 0
you also worked closely with ivanka trump on childcare policies, and she says this, and i want your response. %$* 0
she said it is never appropriate to condone unwanted sexual advance or violence against women. %$* 0
mr. trump must realize it has no place in public or in private conversations today or the past. %$* 0
what does the republican party do after something this? %$* 0
it's like now what? %$* 1
well, look, i think that's why the first instinct by so many of the republican leaders has been to try to put some distance between themselves and donald trump's remarks. %$* 0
i think what kathy mcmorris rodgers did, which is very different from all of those other statements was that she condemned his actions and the next 72 hours for republicans, are going to be crucial. %$* 0
because it's no longer going to be a question of whether or not they agree with what donald trump said. %$* 0
it's going to be whether or not they still stand by this person as their nominee. %$* 0
and that litigation, by candidate by candidate, state by state, is coming. %$* 0
so you know, campaigns that are out there get ready for that, that's where this is going, and they're going to have to make the case for their candidacy, their vision. %$* 0
that it's different from donald trump, to try to separate donald trump from a republican agenda, and that's going to be the charge for the next 30 days for all of these candidates that are up for election, november 8th. %$* 1
go ahead, brian. %$* 1
here's congressman  and chaffetz just a few minutes ago saying he revokes his endorsement of donald trump in a live interview with a local station. %$* 0
trump has not released his video yet, but some of these other politicians are coming on camera, speaking out against trump in ways we've not heard before. %$* 1
utah is ground zero for this right now. %$* 1
because the governor there, too. %$* 0
i don't know if we -- governor chaffetz. %$* 1
i cannot support any way shape, or form the comments or approach donald trump has taken. %$* 1
so here's what the governor says kevin. %$* 0
he says, "donald trump statements are beyond offensive and despicable. %$* 0
while i cannot vote for hillary clinton, i will not vote for trump." %$* 0
so i mean, they're in a predicament. %$* 0
madden:  yes, and look, utah is ground zero for this. %$* 0
i'd expect that donald trump's approval rating in utah -- i was just in salt lake city this week. %$* 0
it's probably somewhere in the thirds. %$* 1
and he has competition there right, kevin? %$* 1
and he has competition there from a third-party candidate, mcmullen, and it's -- and also from gary johnson. %$* 0
now, i think people's --- i think many of these candidates there -- their bravery on confronting donald trump or revoking their endorsement is going to track very closely with some of the numbers that we see come out of people's reaction to this statement, this tape. %$* 0
so when donald trump's numbers start to slide in their district or their state there's going to be more bravery on that end. %$* 1
all right, thank you, panel. %$* 0
i want everyone to stand by and i need to tell our viewers, donald trump, his campaign is under siege tonight because of his comments, but we're waiting on the response from him on videotape. %$* 0
as soon as that happens, we will bring it to you live. %$* 0
we'll be right back. %$* 0
we're back now with my panel. %$* 0
we are going to add some new people, brian stelter, mark preston, rebecca berg, kevin madden, david swerdlick, dana bash, and gloria borger. %$* 0
so gloria, i have to ask you, you know, there's been in question how these tapes came out, why they came out. %$* 0
does it matter how the tapes came out or does matter more that they're out -- it's out there? %$* 1
i don't think it matters how or the timing of it. %$* 0
i think in a way people should be glad it came out before the election rather than after the election. %$* 0
we always like more information than less information about our presidential candidates. %$* 0
but i think what we've seen tonight is really the tipping point here. %$* 0
and what we saw in paul ryan apparently disinviting donald trump from a unity rally tomorrow, and his statement of blame and you know, reince priebus's tough statement. %$* 0
and reince priebus don't forget has been a trump supporter. %$* 0
he declared trump the victor of the primaries after indiana if you recall with a tweet, and he's been at his side through thick and through thin. %$* 0
and tonight, he kind of left him out there dangling and what these republican leaders have done, is give republicans permission to wave goodbye to donald trump. %$* 0
and that is exactly what we saw from congressman chaffetz tonight, who has also been a strong supporter of donald trump's, and he said, look, i'm not going to vote for hillary clinton, they're not crossing that rubicon, but i'm certainly not going to vote for donald trump. %$* 0
and i think that the leaders -- the republican party leaders have given -- have given their flock permission, to go their own way, to make sure that they get reelected in the fall and letting them know in no uncertain terms that it doesn't have anything to do with donald trump. %$* 0
so they're willing -- they said to them, put yourself and put your party ahead of the presidential candidate. %$* 1
i need to tell our viewers again we're awaiting this videotaped statement from donald trump on these controversial comments that he made on "access hollywood" back in 2005. %$* 0
david swerdlick, let me bring you in. %$* 0
the "washington post" brought his story to light with the videotape here, you know, and then brian stelter mentioned on monday this ap report about other allegations that were on the record about other allegations from other employees. %$* 0
and then having the campaign person, hope hix , deny them. %$* 0
how do they reconcile this now? %$* 0
what can he say in the statement? %$* 1
don, they -- i don't know what they're going to stay in the statement and they have a huge hurdle as brian was saying in the last segment, with whatever they come out within the statement because what most people would do, most people hopefully wouldn't find themselves in this situation. %$* 0
but most people in this situation, don, would say, look, this was not my finest hour, i regret what i said, my behavior was reprehensible, i apologize, but in donald trump's case, there is this whole constellation of episodes that are on the record, with him saying demeaning things about women. %$* 0
treating women as two dimensional objects, insulting women, calling women -- women running for president against him, carly fiorina, to their face, talking about their looks. %$* 0
the list goes on, and on, and on. %$* 0
there's not enough time in your show to talk about them. %$* 0
just last week in the debate with secretary clinton, he tried to take credit to give himself brownie points for referring to her as secretary clinton. %$* 0
and then said, does that make you feel better as if to say, there, there little lady that he wasn't talking to a u.s. senator, to a former secretary of state. %$* 0
it's very easy to come to the conclusion with donald trump that he doesn't take women seriously. %$* 0
so i don't know what you can do late on a friday night with a taped statement to knock that view out of the minds of voters. %$* 1
i'm not sure if we are still have the live shot of trump tower on fifth avenue. %$* 0
we did at the beginning of the show. %$* 0
we show today live and we're waiting on the statement to come from donald trump, this video statement. %$* 0
i have to ask you, dana bash, if you can take us inside the trump campaign, what's going on? %$* 1
if i could, i could probably write a series of books. %$* 0
look, what's going on, is that they are in crisis mode. %$* 0
they're in panic mode. %$* 0
this is about as bad as it gets when it comes to a political campaign that was already having trouble finding its footing. %$* 0
trying to get back after a poor showing at the first debate, and more importantly after their candidate kept stepping in it by picking fights with a former miss universe, and after he questioned her looks and so forth. %$* 0
so, the fact that they are where they are now, that -- that as again congresswoman kathy mcmorris rodgers put it so  bluntly, that this tape shows  not just words but also actions, actions that he wanted to do. %$* 0
who knows if he actually did them, which she called violence against women. %$* 0
it's just completely different. %$* 0
so, the answer to your question is, they -- my impression and my understanding and talking to sources is the people around donald trump were trying to really impress upon him how big a deal this is, they need to react, they need to find a way to react, he didn't want to do -- %$* 1
he would have to impress upon how big a deal this is? %$* 1
you never know, don. %$* 0
they -- he didn't want to do television interviews as you heard corey lewandowski live on our air saying if he were still there, he would recommend that -- that donald trump sit down with a reporter and get it out. %$* 0
that was not the way that he wanted to go because he doesn't want to be questioned about it and perhaps from his perspective make it worse so that's why they're doing this very controlled situation with the videotape that we're allegedly getting very soon. %$* 1
mark preston, let me ask you this. %$* 0
hillary clinton, there's a big debate coming up, you know, in less than 48 hours, anderson is going to be moderating it. %$* 0
hillary clinton is tweeting out saying this is horrific. %$* 0
we cannot allow this man to become president. %$* 0
she's -- the strategy here is to sit back and let her opponent do all the work, correct? %$* 1
right. %$* 0
but she has engaged and her campaign has engaged in this. %$* 0
they also sent a text out, you know, basically calling the remarks deplorable with a link on the text, which brought you to the fundraising page -- %$* 1
is that a right strategy? %$* 1
no, it's not a right strategy. %$* 0
what you need to do sometimes in politics you've got to let your opponent continue to dig themselves deeper and deeper into the hole. %$* 0
you don't want to be anywhere near that hole. %$* 0
you wanted to be connected to that hole. %$* 0
because the bottom line, that's his problem and she should step back politically, strategically, step back and allow him to try to deal with it. %$* 0
but clearly, it is such a terrible thing that he said. %$* 0
let's just stop -- i mean, we can talk about, like all the bad words that he used and what have you, but i think we've just got to stop and say he was condoning sexual assault. %$* 0
that's what it is. %$* 1
right. %$* 1
it's very basic and that's what's going to cause, as kevin was saying a lot of problems for republicans who have to look at donald trump at the top of the ticket and have to look at our voters and say, he is our nominee. %$* 0
that is very difficult for them, don. %$* 1
who was that? %$* 0
was it kevin madden or david swerdlick saying he's right to mark preston? %$* 1
look, it's david. %$* 0
i agree with mark. %$* 0
when you get to that one line in the videotape, he's talking about sexual assault, you know, not only is it reprehensible, it's way beyond what he said in his initial statement, this is locker room talk, i've heard -- %$* 1
but you're agreeing about the wrong strategy for the clinton campaign? %$* 1
yes, i agree with mark on that, as well. %$* 0
it's the wrong strategy, very simply, this is a moment for the campaign to let trump sort of just have to stew in this crisis that he's created for himself. %$* 1
it's also a moment for trump and his wife -- let's not forget melania in this conversation. %$* 0
this tape was taped several months after they got married. %$* 0
he's talking about potentially cheating on his spouse. %$* 0
my heart goes out to her in this moment. %$* 0
i hope she's not having to watch. %$* 1
he said melania is ok with this. %$* 0
can you guys all stand by? %$* 0
i'll bring you back in because we want to discuss this. %$* 0
you saw congressman jason chaffetz. %$* 0
we want to bring him in. %$* 0
he says he pulling his endorsement of donald trump. %$* 0
he joins us by phone. %$* 0
congressman, thank you so much for joining us. %$* 0
so please tell us what your reaction is to these repugnant -- it's the only way to describe those statements by donald trump. %$* 1
i'm out. %$* 0
i can no longer endorse donald trump for president. %$* 0
there's no possible way i vote for hillary clinton. %$* 0
but, these are abhorrent. %$* 0
they are wrong. %$* 0
i've got to call balls and strikes the way i feel. %$* 0
and my wife, julie and i, we've got a 15-year-old daughter. %$* 0
do you think i can look her in the eye and tell her that i endorse donald trump for president when he acts like this in his apology? %$* 0
that wasn't an apology. %$* 0
that was an apology for getting caught. %$* 0
to say that bill clinton did it, he did it worse. %$* 0
that was the wrong behavior. %$* 0
i'm not going to put my good name and reputation, and my family behind donald trump for president when he acts like this. %$* 0
i just can't do it. %$* 1
is there anything, congressman, that he can say, in this videotaped statement that is coming out at any moment, that can change things for you or that can redeem him among the voters? %$* 1
i don't know. %$* 0
i don't know. %$* 0
i worried that if, you know, i'd be naive to think there's this and that sort of approach. %$* 0
do you really think this is the only thing that's out there like this? %$* 0
i have to tell you, i played college football, and place kicker, i've been in a lot of locker rooms. %$* 0
this is not just locker room tad. %$* 0
this was offensive, and it was absolutely totally wrong, and i -- i'm not going to endorse him. %$* 0
i'm not going to vote for hillary clinton. %$* 0
there's no way i'm going to do that, but i can't tell the good people of utah, that i endorse a peon who acts like this. %$* 0
we all do silly, stupid stuff and try to make -- probably make jokes that are inappropriate, that. %$* 0
we should all stand up and say we're not going to tolerate this. %$* 0
why should we have a race at the bottom? %$* 0
why can't we stand tall for high moral values? %$* 0
i thought that's who we are as a republican party. %$* 0
i can't endorse this person for president. %$* 1
do you think he step aside? %$* 1
well, i do wish that mike pence was at the top of the ticket. %$* 0
i really do. %$* 0
i think not only his performance at the debate, but he is a person of high moral fiber. %$* 0
i did serve with him in the house for years and i feel bad for the country, i feel bad for the pences. %$* 0
i feel bad for donald trump's his wife and his daughter. %$* 0
i don't know how you looks her in the eye and tries to explain this. %$* 0
it's just tragedy. %$* 0
i don't know what the answer is, but having seen it, talking to my wife, and just -- i can't endorse him. %$* 1
but do you think he should step aside? %$* 0
that was my question. %$* 1
well, like i said, i wished that mike pence was at the top of the ticket and we're going to have to figure that out at the -- in the coming days and weeks, but it is tragic the way it is right now. %$* 1
do you think that house speaker paul ryan should also retract his support for donald trump, congressman? %$* 1
well, everybody's going to have to figure this out for themselves and you know, i can only answer to myself and my wife and i have to feel good about what i do. %$* 0
i've -- in the congress, i call out democrats all day long for when they perform or do something silly and stupid and -- but this goes beyond silly and stupid. %$* 0
this is just intolerable. %$* 0
i can only do what i see fit and maybe others will do the same. %$* 0
maybe others won't. %$* 0
maybe i'll get chastised for it, but i feel good in pulling back my endorsement. %$* 0
i have to do it. %$* 1
you said you spoke with your wife about this, right? %$* 1
yes. %$* 1
if you don't mind, what did you guys say? %$* 0
what you can share with us, if anything? %$* 1
well, i'd hate for anybody to go back and watch or read the comments. %$* 0
she didn't get all the way through the statement. %$* 0
you know, it's -- and the things he said and the way he said them. %$* 0
and that was compounded by his so called the policy and i, you know, i can't -- probably more compelling even than that is my 15-year-old daughter. %$* 0
really, do you want her dad to endorse this person in the way they're behaving to become the president of the united states of america? %$* 0
i can't do that with my 15-year-old daughter, so why should i do that with the rest of utah? %$* 0
i just couldn't do it. %$* 1
so congressman chaffetz, i think people understand that this is politics, that the house speaker is trying to elect as many republicans as possible, right? %$* 0
and that it is a job many see as leaders to elect the person, the party candidate as the president of the united states. %$* 0
but there are going to be people who are going to look at you and look at others and say, "what took you so long? %$* 0
what do you say to them? %$* 1
well, look, i -- the fact that -- i think the messaging of donald trump, the idea that the country's going in the wrong direction, the fact that hillary clinton has this propensity and frequency to look in the camera and just lie, lie, lie, i mean, i originally endorsed marco rubio, i supported mitt romney when he ran for president. %$* 1
i remember that. %$* 1
i was supportive of the issues that he stood a lot. %$* 0
and the message that he was telling america about getting -- making the country great again, i believe in those things. %$* 0
but you're going to have to have that man or woman at the top of the ticket who has the strong moral fiber to actually get it done behind the scenes. %$* 0
and what i've seen behind the scenes now has led me to believe when you hear it, you see it in his own voice, yeah, and to  read the transcript, i just think, all right, that's just a bridge too far. %$* 1
yeah. %$* 0
do you think he's going to lose utah? %$* 0
he could lose utah? %$* 1
you know, let it digest a little bit. %$* 0
i highly doubt it. %$* 0
we haven't voted for a democrat in utah since 1964. %$* 0
so, it's not as if this shock of what's happening suddenly goes to hillary clinton's way, because, again, she has a lot of fundamental flaws and she's probably the most flawed democratic candidate we've seen in my lifetime. %$* 0
so, again, she has a host of problems and i think the country is looking and saying why and how do we get these two people at the top of the ticket. %$* 0
how did that happen? %$* 1
you have been very honest with us, congressman. %$* 0
i have to ask you, do you think donald trump can win now? %$* 0
chaffetz:  you know, i don't know. %$* 0
i don't know. %$* 0
maybe he does. %$* 0
maybe he opens it up and explains to america what he was feeling in, you know, a very forgiving nation. %$* 0
i don't know. %$* 0
i can just tell you as offended as i am and my wife, and i hope my 15-year-old daughter never reads or sees any of that stuff. %$* 0
i just got to say i'm out, i'm no longer endorsing. %$* 0
i just can't do that. %$* 0
congressman, i appreciate your time. %$* 0
thank you so much. %$* 0
my panel is back. %$* 0
that was utah congressman jason chaffetz. %$* 0
mark preston, what do you think? %$* 1
don, let me just read you this e-mail that i've gotten from a democratic strategist about what jason chaffetz just had to say right there, "oh, my god, forget utah." %$* 0
literally the guy leading the investigations of hillary clinton is pulling his support from trump. %$* 0
that says a lot of things. %$* 0
it says that not only someone like jason chaffetz, who's considered a leaders in the house of representatives, has taken a lot of rocks thrown at him for his investigations of hillary clinton, has really been a strong party guy pulling his support is monumental. %$* 0
and if you look at someone like paul ryan, who hesitated to endorse donald trump and went back and forth and try to roll out his own agenda, that he have created a way for republicans to not support trump. %$* 0
it will be really interesting to see what we hear from speaker ryan in the next couple days. %$* 0
because, you know, at this point, speaker ryan is going to worry about maintaining control of the house of representatives. %$* 0
that is his political job. %$* 0
his political job isn't to get donald trump elected. %$* 0
that's donald trump's job. %$* 0
so, we'll see what happens with these house republican leaders as well as the senate republican leaders. %$* 1
he's not even waiting for the statement, kevin. %$* 0
it doesn't matter. %$* 0
you know, he said i can't go over. %$* 0
i can't do it. %$* 1
yeah. %$* 0
and i think it's emblematic of a lot of what's going to happen with a lot of us . %$* 0
look, donald trump, no doubt, has an impressive level of calcified support. %$* 0
there are people who are not going to budge off their support for him. %$* 0
but for many republicans, and this has always been donald trump's challenge, is that there are a lot of conscious objectives out there and there are a lot of people with very lingering doubts. %$* 0
and for many of them, support for donald trump was a political consideration. %$* 0
it was a political calculation. %$* 0
now, what the risk here for donald trump is, that it moves towards a test of character. %$* 0
and in a test of character, when you have to consider his remarks, many people and what you saw from congressman chaffetz are going to -- are going to take back their endorsements. %$* 0
and if -- and he doesn't need a lot of them. %$* 0
i mean, i think he's right. %$* 0
he's not going to win utah. %$* 0
i'm sorry. %$* 0
hillary clinton is not going to win utah. %$* 0
but there can be a bunch of people who now, you know, if it's 15 percent to 20 percent where you depress to vote or not, that is enough to keep donald trump from winning. %$* 1
go ahead, gloria. %$* 1
you know, i've got a text from a democrat who asked the question after chaffetz's decision, how you can be that disgusted by what he said if you still support him for president? %$* 0
and chaffetz was saying i was that discussed and can no long support him for president. %$* 0
but that will be the question that will be the question that every democrat ask, of republican in the debate if republican still supports donald trump. %$* 0
and it's going to be a question that's difficult to answer. %$* 0
and i just want to say one more thing about this evening as we all sit and wait for donald trump's taped statement. %$* 0
it seems to me that the reason he's doing a taped statement is that it's safe. %$* 0
it's much less risky ... %$* 1
oh, yeah. %$* 1
... than, you know, facing the cameras, facing the press. %$* 1
facing the music, yeah. %$* 1
and even going on fox news. %$* 0
it's because donald trump will talk and talk and he's constitutionally incapable of truly apologizing. %$* 0
we know in the past he said i've had regrets and we saw his statement earlier today, which tried to shift the blame in a bizarre way to bill clinton and say it was locker room banter. %$* 0
so the only thing he can do is ... %$* 1
you heard jason chaffetz say that this is beyond locker room banter. %$* 1
right. %$* 0
but the only thing -- the only way they can try and save donald from himself is to do a statement to tape. %$* 1
yeah. %$* 1
because they can have some control over what he says. %$* 1
yeah. %$* 1
can i just have one thing? %$* 1
ok. %$* 1
maybe our viewers don't know ... %$* 1
ok.  dana, can you wait until after? %$* 0
i have to get to the break. %$* 0
and i want to get rebecca in as well. %$* 1
i'd be happy to. %$* 1
so, i will be back with this panel right after the break. %$* 0
but again, i want to say, well, you heard that congressman jason chaffetz from utah saying he pulled his support, he can't do it. %$* 0
we're also waiting a video statement from donald trump that should be released at any moment. %$* 0
don't go anywhere. %$* 0
we'll be right back. %$* 0
we're waiting a videotaped statement from donald trump regarding his controversial comments that he made about women to "access hollywood" back in 2005. %$* 0
back now with my panel. %$* 0
as soon as we get, we'll play it for you. %$* 0
rebecca, if he does apologize in this video tape, is that going to open him up tomorrow, questions about why he didn't apologize for anything else before this? %$* 1
well, sure. %$* 0
this isn't the first controversial state we have heard from donald trump or demeaning statement when it's come to women. %$* 0
and so i think this will open the door for him to have to answer for all of the statements that he made about women over the years and why he has made those statements, why he has treated women in that way. %$* 0
and certainly, he's going to need to offer an explanation and apology and explanation might not be enough. %$* 0
it's a really damaging theme that we have coming on here today. %$* 0
maybe that's why we're seeing some delay in response not only from trump but also from other republican leaders trying to get as sensitive just how damaging this is going to be and how they could be possibly respond to this in a way that would actually be effective and resonate with voters and not tremor people off for be seen as something that fall short. %$* 1
ok. %$* 0
so, we're supposed to get the statement, everyone. %$* 0
we've been hearing about, we got a statement-- we got a printed statement earlier, which said that, you know, this was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago, "bill clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course, not even close. %$* 0
i apologize if anyone was offended." %$* 0
i wonder if it's the same video statement that will be similar to that. %$* 0
but the questions is, this is taken so long. %$* 0
does this blend to of the possibility of an internal struggle within the campaign? %$* 0
can you answer that for me, dana, gloria, bob? %$* 1
yeah. %$* 0
i mean, there's -- well, i was going to say that there's no question. %$* 0
i actually would love to hear kevin madden on this, because he's been in the most recent republican nominee's campaign and he know what happens when there's a crisis. %$* 0
but in real time, just quickly, i was talking to people earlier tonight who were saying that they were sending messages, pleading with donald trump himself. %$* 0
this is a -- it is served in front of me before and it is kind of hard to believe, but just trying to get him to understand that this is a humongous deal, that this is something he's got to deal with it and he can't wait, he can't just release a short statement and that he's got to get in front of it tonight. %$* 0
and my impression from talking to sources was that it was not an easy thing to convince him to do. %$* 0
and once he agreed to do that, then, of course, the content of what he says is a struggle. %$* 1
let's take your advice, though. %$* 0
hang on, bryan, i do want to hear from kevin. %$* 1
well, first of all, dana's right. %$* 0
anytime inside a campaign, the answer is they're a conflict within the campaign especially in a crisis like this. %$* 0
the answer is always yes. %$* 0
the challenge is whether or not you can get through that conflict then have somebody who has some sort of center of power inside that campaign structure to essentially grab the candidate by the lapels and say we have a problem here. %$* 0
if we don't move quickly, we will not live to find another day. %$* 0
and i suspect that the power structure insider this campaign, the trump campaign is the candidate himself. %$* 0
and that reluctance -- these eight hours now that we've gone into further and further into a tailspin is because the candidate himself is reluctant and not clear on what he wants to say this on how to get out of this. %$* 1
well, there's another complicating factor here which is unlike any other campaign i've ever covered. %$* 0
this family is much more involved in the nuts and bolts of running this campaign. %$* 0
i mean, the romney family was very involved, kevin, as you know, but i think you would say not to this degree. %$* 0
and this is a personal story that is obviously usually hurtful to his family members, particularly his daughter, ivanka, who spoke at the convention who has been talking about empowering women, empowering working mothers, helping pay for childcare, for single-working moms and women's issues or near and dear to her heart. %$* 0
and when i interviewed her for the documentary, i asked her point-blank whether her father was a sexist and pushed back very hard and said, "no, no, no, i wouldn't be the woman i am if my father were. %$* 0
so, if you can imagine what it's like... %$* 1
yeah. %$* 1
... not only with the campaign people, but the familiar is involved and that adds a whole other dynamic. %$* 1
ok. %$* 0
stand by, everyone. %$* 0
standby. %$* 0
we will wait the tape. %$* 0
we'll be right back. %$* 0
donald trump's campaign rocked by a bombshell today, the release of his vulgar remarks about women caught on tape. %$* 0
i want to bring bob beckel, and trump supporter scotty nell hughes. %$* 0
and again, we are waiting on a videotaped statement. %$* 0
let's bring in scottie quickly and then hopefully bob will be ready for this. %$* 0
so, what hat do you want to hear scotty? %$* 1
well, i want to hear a sincere apology and explanation of how he changed from 11 years ago. %$* 0
you know, i want to hear that this is not going to need to have any reflections on the policies that he have right now. %$* 0
but i have to tell you, if the clinton's camp -- and the clinton campaign want to create chaos amongst republican party. %$* 0
i'm reading it on social media right now. %$* 0
there are lots of conservatives there that they don't even think that mike pence needs to go and take donald trump's tomorrow, that there needs to be a complete revamping. %$* 0
they're very disappointed in chaffetz coming out and saying ... %$* 1
well, wait, scottie. %$* 0
hold on. %$* 0
slow down. %$* 0
i didn't understand what you say. %$* 0
they don't think that mike pence needs to do what? %$* 1
he needs to go to wisconsin tomorrow, so he needs to take donald trump's place. %$* 0
they're very disappointed in this change of events. %$* 0
they think this is once again just another attack by the clinton camp that the media is falling for. %$* 0
that this is once again just kind of along to track to figure out what we knew was going to be the last . %$* 0
but there is definitely some confusion, some chaos, some discontentment within -- amongst the conservatives, amongst the republican party right now on how the donald trump campaign is handling this. %$* 0
and i'm hoping once this video comes out, that it will put everything straight and then we will wake up tomorrow morning and hopefully be able to continue on this path towards november. %$* 1
ok. %$* 0
so, that's in social media. %$* 0
and so then, you know, that's my speculation and to say that, scottie. %$* 0
so bob beckel, what's the reality here? %$* 0
they're saying that this is, you know, an attack by clinton campaign. %$* 1
well, you know, i think the reality as you would expect, i mean, there's no absolutely no evidence that the clinton campaign was responsible for this. %$* 0
but somebody leaked it. %$* 0
and so be it. %$* 0
i mean, this happens in campaigns. %$* 0
i've been through it many times before. %$* 0
i can tell you internally there is chaos, it's stopped, what are you going to say? %$* 0
what are you going to do up to an including by the way from and calls for him to step aside? %$* 1
what does he say? %$* 0
what does he do? %$* 0
what does he say in the statement, bob beckel? %$* 1
well, what he says, well, i thank god. %$* 0
i think given the history, so here's the problem, if this was just an isolated incident for him, but he's had a week worth of anti-women statements going back over campaign fold, and so it adds credibility to already set view about this guy. %$* 0
i'm telling you i do not rule up the possibility that there are people down ballot who don't want to run with him and if there was a way they can figure out a way to not have to run with him they will. %$* 0
there's a procedure to do that by the way available to them. %$* 0
it would be chaotic, but this could be done. %$* 1
it would be a guaranteed loss though, bob. %$* 0
that would be a very guaranteed loss for them right now. %$* 1
no, it would -- listen. %$* 1
no it would be. %$* 1
believe me when i tell it would be very difficult to do and i understand that. %$* 0
but, you know, you have to ask yourself a question, how much of an influence is this going to have on the average voter out there who's undecided, which are most at this around than they have been in other presidential race as you know? %$* 0
you've got a democratic candidate it was very weak in many ways and you would hope to have pulled some votes away from her. %$* 0
so, i think what trump needs to do is, well, satisfy his base, convince people who are the targets of his new effort, which are educated white voters, that he really is not this way. %$* 0
it's kind of hard to do. %$* 0
if you think about the difficulty of putting out narrative together, it's going to get you out certainly, not by tomorrow morning. %$* 0
and the lesson i'll say is time is so critical to race right now at the presidential level. %$* 0
and he's losing them by every minute that goes by that he can't address something else besides this is minute that is going to cost him enormously coming november. %$* 1
you mentioned congressman jason chaffetz early, scottie, when you said that people were disappointed in chaffetz and others. %$* 0
but there are number of republicans who are coming out now and there are others who have, you know, jumped on the donald trump ship and they're concerned now about going down with the ship. %$* 0
do you think there are going to be other people who are going to just say, you know, i can't do this anymore and how will that that affect donald trump? %$* 1
well, jason was an extreme disappointment. %$* 0
but i think there probably will be others, but those were part of a group that was never trump. %$* 0
so, we probably didn't have them in the first place. %$* 0
so, the problem that i think conservatives and republicans are going to go, wait a minute, you're saying donald is automatically ... %$* 1
he endorsed that. %$* 0
he endorse him, he stood by him in all of -- he's all over every network ... %$* 1
he wasn't -- right. %$* 1
... saying, you know, donald trump ... %$* 1
that's what i'm saying. %$* 0
he's one of the disappointments. %$* 0
so, i'm talking one of the major people have been with him from day one. %$* 0
my problem with this is that means that you actually think that's hillary clinton, because that's basically a vote for hillary clinton . %$* 1
he said that one earlier . %$* 1
but it doesn't matter. %$* 0
he said vote for hillary clinton. %$* 0
that's a mark in her corner. %$* 0
so, all those republican right now that are thinking that you're going to put hillary clinton in office, and then you be held responsible. %$* 1
that's been your only argument. %$* 0
is it a vote for -- to not vote for trump? %$* 0
it's a vote for hillary. %$* 0
but look, it's not hillary clinton here is the issue. %$* 0
the issue is donald trump. %$* 0
and the question is, is he fit? %$* 0
does he have the temperament to be president? %$* 0
and i'll tell you, you have to listen to this. %$* 0
i'm not surprised to be honest with you. %$* 0
anyone has no surprise here about bill clinton when he his problems. %$* 0
but because the public deserves -- expects something like this out in trump. %$* 0
but you have been down ballot. %$* 0
you've got a lot to lose and you've got a senate at risk, which is a very big deal. %$* 0
and so, my guess is a lot of talk in back channels among republicans who want to get rid of this guy. %$* 1
but they can't. %$* 0
the promise is to guarantee . %$* 0
there's already been ballots issued with name printed on it. %$* 1
yes, there have been. %$* 0
you're right. %$* 1
there already have been absentee votes. %$* 0
so, at this point, it is. %$* 0
you have two choices in this election. %$* 0
you're not voting for donald trump, you're voting for hillary clinton. %$* 0
and right now -- and with mike pence as the vice president with the supreme court -- listen on this, as a conservative, as a republican, i don't see how in anyway you can have a conscience, vote your conscience and say you're not voting donald trump while putting hillary clinton in office. %$* 0
it sounds like a good thing. %$* 1
ok. %$* 0
standby everyone. %$* 0
you're just tuning in at what is happening right. %$* 0
thank you, guys. %$* 0
it's been stunning. %$* 0
so, donald trump makes the statements on camera back in 2005. %$* 0
they come out today. %$* 0
the campaign is rocked. %$* 0
he responds blaming bill clinton and saying he apologizes to anyone that he offended. %$* 0
and now, we have been waiting. %$* 0
it's almost midnight for this videotape by donald trump statement. %$* 0
nothing so far. %$* 0
at any moment they said they're going to release. %$* 0
what's going to happen next? %$* 0
i'm sitting here telling you, i don't know. %$* 0
we'll be right back. %$* 1
