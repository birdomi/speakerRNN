all eyes on that first vote being cast here in dixville notch. %$* 0
a lot of excitement. %$* 0
a lot of excitement. %$* 1
here we go -- midnight. %$* 0
missed it. %$* 0
whoa. %$* 1
there you go. %$* 1
they have one job. %$* 0
one job -- rachel. %$* 1
i know. %$* 0
and now, don, that eighth voter, who is also registering right now just went into the booth to mark her ballot. %$* 0
now, one of the ballots this evening is an absentee so seven of the eight votes are being conducted here in person. %$* 0
and as i mentioned don, it only takes a couple of minutes for them to count the votes this evening and then they mark with a pen on this white board right here what the results are. %$* 0
we'll have those in just a couple of minutes right now on dixville notch -- %$* 1
let me jump in -- rachel, as we're waiting -- %$* 1
yes. %$* 1
-- here. %$* 0
so let's talk about what happened. %$* 0
bernie sanders beat hillary clinton 4-0; i'm talking about the primary. %$* 0
john kasich beat donald trump there to two in the primaries back in february. %$* 1
we'll finish in less than a minute. %$* 1
less than a minute they say. %$* 0
so, we saw how well that fared. %$* 0
kasich and sanders voters are, you know, i'm sure tonight they're saying hey, this didn't show -- wasn't a predictor of what was to come. %$* 1
by state law we can have a motion from the town. %$* 1
right -- don. %$* 0
i did speak with one kasich voter -- a voter who voted for kasich in the primary. %$* 0
he said that he was in fact going to be voting for clinton this evening. %$* 0
also spoke with one of those sanders voters who said that he also will be voting for clinton this evening. %$* 0
so, you know, unsure of what the rest of those voters. %$* 0
we do know that one of those -- %$* 1
let's listen, rachel. %$* 0
the polls are closed. %$* 0
let's listen in. %$* 0
all right. %$* 0
just -- i want to remind the viewers who are just tuning in, you are watching -- these are the first votes being cast in dixville notch, new hampshire. %$* 0
and since it's only a handful of people, just over a handful of people there, we'll be able to see in just moments how this fares. %$* 0
but again, the first votes being cast. %$* 0
this is the beginning of the beginning or the beginning of the end depending on who you support here. %$* 0
we're going to figure out how the -- %$* 1
do another demographic. %$* 1
-- how new hampshire went. %$* 0
so i'm just going to sit out for a little bit just so you that can see our democratic process at work. %$* 0
it should be pretty quickly considering there's only, what, nine voters here. %$* 0
and one of them the first time -- %$* 1
there's eight voters -- don, in here. %$* 1
eight voters but one of them -- i said nine because you said that one was registering right now and i wasn't sure if that was nine. %$* 1
tonight. %$* 1
yes, tonight. %$* 1
yes. %$* 1
but still a total of eight. %$* 1
yes, still a total of eight. %$* 0
one, an absentee ballot and one of those seven is being conducted in person was also registered today. %$* 0
it's happening right now. %$* 0
and you know, don, it's also important to point out that dixville notch is not the only place where midnight voting takes place in new hampshire; also in hart's location as well as millsfield, new hampshire. %$* 0
now, they all take advantage of this quirky law here in new hampshire that allows for midnight voting in towns with less than 100 people and they can close the polls once all of those that are registered to vote have voted. %$* 0
so that's what is happened here this evening in dixville notch and it's also happening in hart's location as well as millsfield. %$* 0
looks like we're about to get the results right now -- don. %$* 1
ok.  let's see what we have. %$* 0
i know everyone is afraid of dead air on television but i think we should just watch this. %$* 0
i find it very interesting. %$* 1
it's very riveting. %$* 0
the room is abuzz, though, i'll tell you. %$* 1
yes. %$* 0
do you know, as we wait -- %$* 1
there's definitely a lot more media than -- there's a lot more media -- %$* 1
yes, than there are voters who actually voted. %$* 1
-- than there are voters. %$* 0
yes. %$* 1
i don't want to miss the count, rachel, but do we know what the breakdown of voters are there? %$* 1
no, not just yet. %$* 0
they are tallying -- %$* 1
do we know the men, women, that sort of thing? %$* 1
my understanding is there's two female voters and the rest are men. %$* 1
let's get to -- is mark preston there? %$* 0
mark. %$* 1
no, mark preston is not here. %$* 0
he was here in the primary. %$* 1
no, no, i'm sorry. %$* 0
i was talking to the producers. %$* 0
i was talking to the producers. %$* 0
if you can open up mark preston, our executive editor -- politics editor. %$* 0
mark when you i did this in the primary, weren't there nine voters in dixville notch? %$* 0
did they lose a voter? %$* 1
gosh, you're -- you're testing me. %$* 0
i don't remember what happened nine minutes ago in this presidential campaign rather than when i was up in dixville notch -- %$* 1
they did lose a voter. %$* 1
see? %$* 0
they did. %$* 0
ok.  rachel is -- rachel crane is answering. %$* 1
there you are. %$* 1
they did lose a voter. %$* 0
one of them moved away. %$* 1
oh, no. %$* 1
yes. %$* 0
one of them moved away. %$* 0
dwindling, i know, unfortunately. %$* 0
the number's dwindling here -- they went from nine to seven. %$* 0
but luckily they got an eighth at the last minute. %$* 1
so that's the panel here. %$* 0
that's my political panel who you hear the laughing here -- bakari sellers, corey lewandowski, maria cardona, andy dean, margaret hoover and hilary rosen. %$* 0
they're all here. %$* 0
and they're laughing because, you know, he moved away -- he or she moved away. %$* 0
dixville notch now just eight voters. %$* 1
kind of odd. %$* 1
well, i got to point out that dixville notch, don, is very remote. %$* 1
yes, hold on. %$* 1
yes. %$* 0
and this is a very remote area. %$* 1
hold on rachel -- stand by. %$* 0
what were you saying -- hilary. %$* 1
we are only 20-mile -- ok. %$* 1
i was saying that this actually does feel like a moment that this campaign of almost two years is actually ending right now. %$* 1
here we go -- don. %$* 1
so you've got the first voters in dixville notch and you have lady gaga on the other side in north carolina. %$* 0
let's listen in. %$* 1
hillary clinton got four votes. %$* 1
hillary clinton four votes. %$* 1
donald trump -- %$* 1
donald trump -- %$* 1
-- two votes. %$* 1
-- two votes. %$* 0
two votes for trump, four votes for clinton. %$* 1
the libertarian -- %$* 1
johnson, weld -- one vote. %$* 1
johnson, one vote. %$* 1
and a write in for mitt romney. %$* 1
write in for mitt romney. %$* 0
there you have it. %$* 1
there you have it. %$* 0
ok so we're good. %$* 0
this is for governor. %$* 0
rachel crane -- %$* 1
this is the down ballot. %$* 1
all right. %$* 0
they want to see down ballot. %$* 0
stand by. %$* 0
repeat that, rachel. %$* 1
united states senator. %$* 0
maggie hassan four. %$* 1
clinton four; trump, two -- %$* 1
no, no -- not that. %$* 0
hold on. %$* 1
one for johnson. %$* 1
kelly ayotte, four. %$* 0
for representative -- ann custer, four; and kim lawrence, four. %$* 1
tied. %$* 0
wow. %$* 1
that's it for the major races. %$* 0
if anybody's interested we can also read off the executive counselors. %$* 0
kennedy, six. %$* 1
ok. %$* 0
thank you -- rachel. %$* 0
i appreciate that. %$* 0
so margaret you were interested in down ballot. %$* 0
and it's interesting because there is a tie -- right. %$* 1
yes, there is a tie. %$* 0
i mean that's i think how republicans have seen. %$* 0
those are those republicans who have had a hard time supporting donald trump but cared deeply about holding the united states senate are really looking to whether there are ballot splitters, ticket splitters rather. %$* 0
it was sort of settling down in the final days of the campaign as though ticket splitters in new hampshire were looking like they were voting clinton/ayotte. %$* 0
and so it's interesting to see there that basically maggie hassan, the sitting governor, female governor of the state and kelly ayotte, sitting u.s. senator, he female senator of the state seem to be neck and neck in that very first counting of the ballots in new hampshire. %$* 1
all right. %$* 0
panel -- stand by. %$* 0
i want to bring in mark preston -- back in mark preston and "washington post's" ryan lizza and david swerdlick. %$* 0
ok, as we see, lady gaga up on the screen -- do we want to continue on or are we going to listen to lady gaga? %$* 1
let's listen in to lady gaga. %$* 1
he's a little jealous. %$* 1
lady gaga in north carolina. %$* 1
north carolina, can you hear me? %$* 0
we want you to stand up. %$* 0
be a part of history. %$* 0
what i'm asking you is to be in this moment right now with us. %$* 0
and fight for your future and the future of our children. %$* 0
you know, it's so amazing because no matter how absurd and mean he became, she smiled bravely. %$* 0
and she continued on. %$* 0
i almost feel like i could do her smile. %$* 0
she kept going and she kept fighting for women's rights. %$* 0
she kept fighting for the care of our children. %$* 0
she kept fighting for those who are in need. %$* 0
and the truth is that hillary clinton has done this for her entire career. %$* 0
and now when i say career, what i mean is she didn't wake up one morning and decide she wanted to be president -- right? %$* 0
she's had a career in politics that spans decades of experience -- education, leadership, and wisdom. %$* 0
she stands before us today -- proud, like a lady. %$* 0
she -- she's ready to be president. %$* 0
and by the way -- by the way, i know that it is important for this message, too, to be spread -- that we do not need to hate his followers. %$* 1
ok. %$* 0
so dueling rallies there. %$* 0
you have lady gaga on the right of your screen. %$* 0
she's in north carolina. %$* 0
and you have mike pence there on the left of your screen. %$* 0
he is in michigan this evening. %$* 0
and boy, this is going to go on all night into the wee hours because we are getting down to the final hours of this campaign. %$* 0
we had the -- donald trump is going to come up in grand rapids in just a moment. %$* 0
but we had the first votes cast and, my panel, i agree with you, hilary rosen, it feels like a moment. %$* 0
like this is finally going to be over very soon. %$* 0
so let's talk until we see donald trump come up and we dip back into this. %$* 0
i want to bring in again -- bring in my panel and also bring in mark preston, ryan lizza and david swerdlick. %$* 0
mark -- i'm going to ask you first. %$* 0
the next president of the united states will be elected today. %$* 0
can you believe it? %$* 1
no. %$* 0
and i'll say this. %$* 0
whoever wins tomorrow is going to have a very difficult time coming here to washington and getting things done whether it's hillary clinton and her battles with republicans on capitol hill -- %$* 1
whoever wins today -- mark, what's that, now? %$* 0
whoever wins today. %$* 1
whoever wins today, right. %$* 0
dixville notch has voted, forgive me. %$* 0
right. %$* 0
but i'll tell you this. %$* 0
you know, even if donald trump wins and he comes to washington he doesn't get along with republicans either. %$* 0
i just think that there needs to be an incredible amount of healing that needs to happen. %$* 0
and it's going to take some time for that to happen not only here in washington but across the nation. %$* 0
and i do think that there's going to be an incredible amount of frustration that washington is getting nothing done because there is going to be a lot of partisanship probably at levels we have never seen before. %$* 0
lemon:  ryan -- when we were, when we heard the votes being counted %$* 0
and read back in dixville notch. %$* 0
at first when we heard clinton -- because there are eight voters there, right. %$* 0
we heard "clinton, four" -- everyone went oh, no. %$* 1
deadlock. %$* 1
we want this to be over. %$* 0
but it actually turned out not to be a deadlock. %$* 0
it's clinton four, trump two, johnson one and there was one write in for mitt romney. %$* 1
i know. %$* 0
i was thinking maybe even -- %$* 1
kevin madden. %$* 1
kevin madden was up there. %$* 0
but yes, it sounds like a never trump republican up in dixville notch. %$* 0
i will say, you have to give dixville notch a little bit of credit. %$* 0
whoever does pr for dixville notch, they should get some kind of an award. %$* 1
yes. %$* 0
it is interesting. %$* 0
david swerdlick -- again, as we watch these rallies it's going to only become more intense. %$* 0
but at some point, you know, rallies really don't make a difference. %$* 0
it really is about people getting out to the polls and at a certain point people have to go to sleep in order to be able to wake up to get to the voting booth tomorrow. %$* 1
yes, at this point, don, it really is in the hands of the voters. %$* 0
but i will echo what hilary rosen said. %$* 0
it does feel like a moment watching on the monitors. %$* 0
you have in michigan, mike pence; in raleigh, north carolina, lady gaga; and then dixville notch -- right. %$* 0
i don't think it's a sign of anything to come necessarily but i did think it was interesting that there was a vote for mitt romney. %$* 0
of course, he summers up there in new hampshire. %$* 0
he is a new england guy but, you know, he was someone who bowed out of this race kind of early because it seemed at the time before we were talking about donald trump that jeb bush would be the heir apparent on the republican side and then mitt romney was the guy in march who came out and gave this full-throated denunciation of donald trump. %$* 0
so sort of interesting to me that one person up there, you know, marked a ballot for him right, as we kicked this off. %$* 1
i think though mark preston is right though when he talks about what is going to happen tomorrow which is wednesday but, you know, if you want to be specific about it. %$* 0
there's going to have to be a lot of healing regardless of who wins. %$* 0
and i -- you know, it's concerning to me about people actually getting together, because there's been so much consternation and people have been fighting so much. %$* 0
do you think that's actually possible -- maria cardona? %$* 1
i'm going to be optimistic and positive here. %$* 0
i do think that it's possible for a couple of reasons. %$* 0
people do look back at this year and a half with disgust and just, you know, exhaustion. %$* 0
and i think most people are ready to see something happen in washington. %$* 0
and the only -- and the other reason i think that we can see something positive here is that i believe hillary clinton is going to win. %$* 0
and let's look back at her tenure in the senate. %$* 0
one of the very great things about her and what she did in the senate is that she actually was able to work very well with republicans. %$* 0
she was able to reach across party lines and vice versa because people knew she was there ready to listen. %$* 0
she does look beyond partisanship. %$* 0
she looks beyond party. %$* 0
she wants to look at the solutions. %$* 1
yes. %$* 0
but can the voter do that? %$* 1
i think the voter can do that because again, they looked at sort of the acrimony of what has happened in this election and how divisive it's been. %$* 0
and yes, there will be partisans on both sides that will be mad no matter who wins, mad at the other side that did win. %$* 0
but i think in general people are going to take a look at this and say this is our democracy. %$* 0
this is what we decided. %$* 0
let's move forward to try to find solutions. %$* 1
all right. %$* 0
listen, i hope you are right. %$* 0
but mark preston, i've got to say, this feels different. %$* 0
this is my third election cycle here at cnn. %$* 0
and i've covered, you know, a number before. %$* 0
this feels different with the, you know, the rigged system, the lock her up, the media is biased and all of. %$* 0
i mean i just -- i worry about that. %$* 0
am i wrong to be worried about that? %$* 1
no, no, no. %$* 0
you're right on. %$* 0
i mean look, we've been spending a lot of time, don, talking about the republican party up in flames right now and how they have to reconstitute and, you know, will there be two parties. %$* 0
and has the grassroots taken their pitchforks and are they going to run the establishment out of town? %$* 0
what's going to happen is that you're going to see not to the same levels we've seen with republicans but we're going to see that with democrats as well. %$* 0
hillary clinton doesn't push forward on a very progressive agenda, then you're going to see the likes of elizabeth warren and bernie sanders and other liberal democrats wonder why they supported her. %$* 0
so you are going to see a fracturing among the party, not again, to the level that we've seen with the republican party but it is certainly going to happen in the democratic party. %$* 0
i do want to say one thing though if you look at your tv screen right now -- %$* 1
yes. %$* 0
and i was. %$* 1
right. %$* 0
there is just -- the imagery that we have all gone through over the past couple days whether it was david chalian doing the map as beyonce was dancing or lady gaga who is -- i don't know what she is doing, that's her dance as mike pence is, you know, like fire and brimstone. %$* 1
she is wearing a pantsuit by the way. %$* 1
right, yes. %$* 0
like, by the way that's a strange -- i don't know. %$* 1
it's lady gaga, mark. %$* 0
i get what you're saying. %$* 0
i get what you're saying. %$* 0
it's really been -- %$* 1
first you put down the boss, now you go after lady gaga. %$* 1
i know, i know, i know. %$* 0
this has been an amazing day. %$* 0
it really has -- %$* 1
he is coming alive right now with some of those hand gestures. %$* 1
yes. %$* 0
so listen -- listen. %$* 1
-- is that hillary clinton has made her closing argument positive. %$* 0
and i do think that that says something about what kind of president she hopes to be. %$* 1
it sets a tone. %$* 1
i have to say that it's interesting to watch and here we go. %$* 0
you're right. %$* 0
this is -- we're here. %$* 0
and we'll know by day's end hopefully who the next president of the united states will be. %$* 0
and let's hope that there is a kumbaya. %$* 0
donald trump is going to be speaking very shortly. %$* 0
but i have to say this. %$* 0
you have lady gaga up on stage and we want to know what she's doing. %$* 0
so lady gaga will play us into the break and we'll be back on the other side. %$* 0
just past midnight here on the east coast and election day and hillary clinton/donald trump both still campaigning tonight. %$* 0
i can't believe i'm actually saying it is election day finally. %$* 0
cnn's jim acosta is in grand rapids, michigan for us. %$* 0
donald trump expected to take the stage for a final rally there. %$* 0
jeff zeleny is in raleigh, north carolina where hillary clinton is due to take the stage at any moment now. %$* 0
jim acosta, it's election day. %$* 1
yes. %$* 1
what's going on? %$* 0
what's the energy like there? %$* 1
well, i'm smiling. %$* 1
yes. %$* 1
you know you were talking about this juxtaposition between lady gaga and ted nugent who was warming up the crowd here in michigan for donald trump. %$* 0
i guess we really do have two americas and we're going to find out which of these two americas comes out on top tomorrow. %$* 0
ted nugent symbolizes a lot of what donald trump is after here in michigan. %$* 0
he's after working-class voters, kind of voters who -- like the motor city bad man as ted nugent is called. %$* 0
but ted nugent also represents something of a problem for the republican party. %$* 0
the republican party has a ted nugent problem. %$* 0
he sort of represents this bitter, angry side car of the conservative movement that turns off a lot of voters. %$* 0
you know, before he was warming up the crowd for mike pence who was just on the stage behind me, don. %$* 0
ted nugent said that secret service officers removed a knife from him and he joked because the knife was too bloody. %$* 0
you know, that kind of rhetoric, it might fire up a very, very conservative crowd in the remaining days of a campaign but it also just turns off lots and lots of voters. %$* 0
so that is a problem that this campaign has had to overcome all along. %$* 0
now we are in michigan. %$* 0
it is kind of an extraordinary thing that we are in michigan but it also highlights the other problem for donald trump and the republican party and that is that this party just needs to win states in the north, states with big urban populations. %$* 0
states like michigan and they are just not capable of doing that at this point or so it seems. %$* 0
now, i talked to people inside the trump campaign and they are looking at a lot of polling, don, internally they say. %$* 0
they're not willing to share with us. %$* 0
that shows that they have a real shot of winning this state. %$* 0
but as we know, we have been looking at the polls and the maps and so forth. %$* 0
unless they can win these battleground states, almost a clean sweep and flip a state like michigan it's just going to be very hard for donald trump. %$* 0
now mike pence was just out on stage a few moments ago getting this crowd ready for donald trump. %$* 0
he basically said, in his closing comments here that donald trump is ready to be president. %$* 0
it was almost as if he was trying to reassure perhaps even some people in this crowd here tonight who are just aren't completely certain whether or not donald trump is ready to be president of the united states. %$* 0
the other thing that i thought was interesting, don, he really went after the fbi -- mike pence. %$* 0
he is sort of the mild mannered half of this gop ticket, he really went after the fbi, almost went after the fbi director and that decision to not bring any charges against hillary clinton. %$* 0
and at one point said, "says who" when it comes to this idea that hillary clinton should not be charged for having that private e-mail server and the e-mails that she'd exchanged over that server. %$* 0
so lots of red meat being dished out in this crowd tonight, don. %$* 0
whether any of that translates into a very much-needed win here in michigan we'll find out later -- i shouldn't say tomorrow -- we'll find out later on today -- don. %$* 1
absolutely. %$* 0
all right. %$* 0
stand by, jim acosta. %$* 0
jeff zeleny -- jeff, you know, there are a lot of people who are upset with me because i didn't play the lady gaga but we actually can't play it. %$* 0
there are restrictions. %$* 0
but maybe you can tell us about it. %$* 1
that's right -- don. %$* 0
you can see behind me here, i hope you can. %$* 0
now, lady gaga is at the piano right now playing at this crowd of north carolina state university here in raleigh. %$* 0
she just finished playing "bad romance" and now she is playing a new song, she said. %$* 0
and of course, this is the latest in a string of entertainers the clinton campaign has brought on board quite frankly to inject some enthusiasm into their campaign and to get some younger voters signed up so they can text them tomorrow, so they can call them tomorrow, they can get them out to the polls. %$* 0
now we'll see if all that works. %$* 0
don, i just flew here from philadelphia and jon bon jovi was on the plane with the clintons. %$* 0
he walked down the steps of the plane with the clintons. %$* 0
of course, he performed in philadelphia earlier this evening. %$* 0
bruce springsteen was there as well. %$* 0
and of course, donald trump has criticized the clinton campaign for bringing all these entertainers, don. %$* 0
but again the clinton campaign calls it an organizing tool in a way to fire up their voters and to get their contact information to get them to the polls. %$* 0
but the reason we're here in north carolina, don, north carolina is the one battleground state that most clinton advisers told me will be the closest. %$* 0
they believe it's on a razor's edge either way. %$* 0
they are not confident of a victory here by any means. %$* 0
it's why hillary clinton is back here for a midnight rally, not something she ordinarily does. %$* 0
donald trump does a lot more late night rallies than her. %$* 0
she wanted to come here to north carolina to give one final push to try and win this state that went democratic in '08 and went republican in 2012 -- don. %$* 1
all right -- jeff. %$* 0
that is a new song on her album, i actually got to see her perform it here in new york city. %$* 0
it's called "angel down" and it was written about trayvon martin and what happened in sanford, florida a few years ago. %$* 0
anyway, if you listen to the lyrics, "angel down", you will understand, you'll figure that out. %$* 0
thank you very much. %$* 0
i appreciate it. %$* 0
now, i want to bring in margaret hoover, republican consultant; andy dean, a trump supporter; democratic strategist maria cardona; andre bauer, a donald trump supporter, hilary rosen who is supporting clinton; michael nutter, the former mayor of philadelphia, also a clinton supporter. %$* 0
so all i have to say is here we are, mayor. %$* 0
what do you think? %$* 0
michael nutter, former mayor of philadelphia:  six and a half hours %$* 0
until the polls open in pennsylvania. %$* 0
we're looking for a great turnout in philadelphia, the philadelphia suburbs, out in the west, lehigh valley, harrisburg, erie. %$* 0
hillary clinton takes pennsylvania tomorrow. %$* 0
andre, you're new to the panel -- what do you make of what is happening? %$* 0
you've got, you know, on one side of the screen, you have lady gaga who was doing her thing; and then on the other side, you had mike pence standing there warming up the crowd for donald trump. %$* 0
i mean it feels like a moment and let's hope -- hopefully, you know, it's not deadlocked and we're not sitting here on wednesday going "my goodness, it's not over yet". %$* 1
who knew a concert was the way to win the white house? %$* 0
style over substance. %$* 0
i mean, you know, when you got k street, wall street, and the big goldman sachs folks funding everything, you can hire every performer out there. %$* 0
let's not be, you know, confused here. %$* 0
these are paid performers that are out there to see the boss having to reap a speech instead of giving it from his heart. %$* 0
that ain't the boss i know. %$* 1
i'm so confuse when you were saying there -- because when you said style over substance i actually thought you were talking about donald trump. %$* 1
no, seriously, because he is the style guy and i'm like where is he going with this? %$* 1
first of all, none of these performers are being paid to do this. %$* 0
they are doing this because they want to. %$* 1
i don't know if that is true. %$* 0
if you look back obama -- %$* 1
i know it is true. %$* 0
it is true. %$* 1
hillary paid katy perry $70,000. %$* 1
they pay travel expenses. %$* 0
they pay travel expenses. %$* 0
yes, they don't pay them. %$* 1
all right, here we go, donald trump taking the stage in grand rapids. %$* 0
let's listen. %$* 1
thank you very much. %$* 0
thank you. %$* 0
thank you, everybody. %$* 0
wow. %$* 0
thank you. %$* 1
thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 0
so you know we added this stop about 12 minutes ago and look at this place. %$* 0
this is incredible. %$* 0
and we don't need -- we don't need jay z or beyonce. %$* 0
we don't need jon bon jovi. %$* 0
we don't need lady gaga. %$* 0
all we need is great ideas to make america great again. %$* 0
that's all we need. %$* 0
that's all we need. %$* 0
so it's now officially tuesday, november 8th. %$* 0
did you ever think you'd be hearing a major speech like around close to 1:00 in the morning? %$* 0
are we crazy? %$* 0
is this crazy? %$* 0
it's crazy. %$* 0
but, you know, we just left new hampshire, where we are doing fantastically well. %$* 0
we're up in new hampshire. %$* 0
we're up in ohio. %$* 0
we're up in iowa. %$* 0
we're up in north carolina. %$* 0
we're doing great there. %$* 0
we're up in florida. %$* 0
we're doing really, really well in pennsylvania. %$* 0
i mean, we are doing well. %$* 0
these people, the world's most dishonest people, the media, they are not happy. %$* 0
no, no. %$* 0
they're not happy. %$* 0
they're saying what's going on? %$* 0
today, we're going to win the great state of michigan and we are going to win back the white house. %$* 0
we're hours away from a once-in-a-lifetime change. %$* 0
we're going to have real change, not obama change. %$* 0
i want to begin tonight by thanking all of you and all of the people in this incredible movement. %$* 0
you know it's a movement like it has never happened in this country before. %$* 0
it's a movement that nobody's ever seen before even these people. %$* 0
they talk about it. %$* 0
it's one of the great political phenomena, many of them have said it, even some of them who truly, truly dislike me. %$* 0
they've said this is one of the great phenomenon. %$* 0
i mean, look at this place at almost 1:00 in the morning. %$* 0
so i love michigan. %$* 0
and i was the man of the year or something like four or five years ago. %$* 0
and i came here and i have so many friends in michigan, but i came here to get the award. %$* 0
they asked me to make a speech. %$* 0
i made a speech and i talked about how michigan, they are ripping your auto companies apart, they are taking your jobs, they are closing your plants and then moving them to mexico and other places but mostly to mexico in this case. %$* 0
and i talked about that and everybody liked me in michigan. %$* 0
and i said, but you know, we have to do something about it, but i wasn't a politician. %$* 0
but i talked about it and i kept talking about it and talking about it and talking. %$* 0
and then i see ford moving a big plant and then ford just two weeks ago announcing their small cars are going to be produced and made entirely in mexico. %$* 0
and it's getting worse and worse. %$* 0
and i developed a great relationship with the people of michigan. %$* 0
so the reason i'm here is that i thought new hampshire was going to be my last speech. %$* 0
and i heard that crooked hillary clinton was coming to michigan, and i said let's follow it up. %$* 0
let's follow it up. %$* 0
and i said there's no place i'd rather be for my last rally right here in michigan. %$* 0
late at night and full of energy and life. %$* 0
boy, do we have energy and life! %$* 0
wow! %$* 0
although this is our last rally of this campaign, it's almost hard to believe. %$* 0
we started a year and a half ago. %$* 0
we started with 17 very talented people, governors, senators, dr. ben carson, great guy. %$* 0
a lot of talented people. %$* 0
and one by one by one, and most of them have been terrific and give us great support. %$* 0
ben carson is one of them as you know. %$* 0
but who would have thought, and now we have one flawed candidate left to beat. %$* 0
one flawed candidate. %$* 0
it's going to be the very beginning of a new adventure. %$* 0
because the new adventure, we have to win. %$* 0
we have to go out and vote. %$* 0
but the new adventure is making america great again. %$* 0
we're going to do it. %$* 0
after we win, i'm going to be coming back to michigan a lot. %$* 0
i'm going to be coming back every time we open a new factory or a new automobile plant and we will do it. %$* 0
we'll do a lot of expansion. %$* 0
we're going to do a lot of expansion. %$* 0
i know exactly what to do, folks. %$* 0
we're not going to lose your jobs anymore. %$* 0
we're not going to lose your jobs anymore. %$* 0
we are going to bring back the automobile industry to michigan. %$* 0
bigger and better and stronger than ever before. %$* 0
you've been mistreated. %$* 0
michigan now stands at the crossroads of history. %$* 0
if we win michigan, we will win this historic election. %$* 0
and then we truly will be able to do all of the things we want to do. %$* 0
they won't be taking our jobs any longer. %$* 0
they won't be doing the things they've been doing to us. %$* 0
we'll end up having great health care, strong borders. %$* 0
we'll build up our military. %$* 0
we have no choice. %$* 0
we have a depleted military. %$* 0
we'll be able to do the things we want to do. %$* 0
when you step into that voting booth today, it's now today. %$* 0
there is one core question for you to consider. %$* 0
do you want america to be ruled by the corrupt political class? %$* 0
or do you want america to be ruled by you, the people? %$* 0
that's what it is, by the people. %$* 0
the way it was supposed to have been for a long time. %$* 0
we've lost track. %$* 0
and for michigan, we will bring back your automobile production. %$* 0
and we will bring back your industry. %$* 0
wait until you see what we do for michigan. %$* 0
i've been talking about it for a long time. %$* 0
crooked hillary has not talked about it, folks. %$* 0
she doesn't know where to begin. %$* 0
she talks about bringing industry back to new york state, when she was a new york state senator. %$* 0
let me tell you, not only didn't it come back, look at upstate new york. %$* 0
it's a disaster. %$* 0
it got worse. %$* 0
people fled, companies fled. %$* 0
it's a disaster. %$* 0
the corrupt politicians and their special interests have ruled over this country for a very long time. %$* 0
today is our independence day. %$* 0
today, the american working-class is going to strike back finally. %$* 0
real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing the disaster known as obamacare. %$* 0
it's just been announced that the residents of michigan are going to experience a massive double-digit premium hike like you wouldn't believe. %$* 0
it's not going to matter that much, honestly, because we're going to terminate it. %$* 0
you're not going to have to worry about it, ok? %$* 0
don't worry. %$* 0
now on the other hand, if something horrible happens tomorrow, get ready to pay a lot more than you're even paying now, but that's not going to happen. %$* 0
i'm looking at that fantastic young lady right there. %$* 0
she's shaking her head, no way, no way. %$* 0
not going to happen, right? %$* 0
good. %$* 0
it's not going to happen. %$* 0
no, i don't think you're going to have to worry about the premiums. %$* 0
but with obamacare, premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting and deductibles are going right through the roof. %$* 0
yet hillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare, making it even more expensive and it doesn't work. %$* 0
it's no good. %$* 0
i'm asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace obamacare and save health care for every family in michigan and throughout the united states of america. %$* 0
we have to do it. %$* 0
we don't have a choice. %$* 0
real change also means restoring honesty to our government. %$* 0
so the first thing we should do, let's get rid of hillary, ok? %$* 0
that's probably -- that would be a very good first step. %$* 0
that's a good first step. %$* 0
hillary clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the united states. %$* 0
she is being protected by a totally rigged system that i've been talking about for a long time. %$* 0
it's a rigged system. %$* 0
now it's up to the american people to deliver justice at the ballot box. %$* 0
i don't have to say do it tomorrow, do it in a week, you're going to do it today. %$* 0
you're going to sleep for a couple of hours, right? %$* 0
go to sleep. %$* 0
you go to sleep for a couple of hours, you wake up and you cast your vote. %$* 0
then you can go back to sleep or go to work. %$* 0
you people don't go to sleep, you go back to work. %$* 0
i know my people. %$* 0
you'll get up after about two hours, you'll vote, and you'll go to work. %$* 0
i know my michigan people. %$* 0
i know. %$* 0
i have so many friends here. %$* 0
they work. %$* 0
they don't stop. %$* 0
we are finally going to close the history books on the clintons and their lies and schemes and corruption. %$* 0
we will open a bright new chapter, focused on you, the american people. %$* 0
my contract with the american voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take our country back from the special interests. %$* 0
i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear our words, our words! %$* 0
when we say you know what we're going to say? %$* 0
we're going to win today and we're going to washington, d.c. to drain the swamp! %$* 0
absolutely. %$* 0
absolutely. %$* 0
you probably heard me say it. %$* 0
drain the swamp. %$* 0
ok. %$* 0
there is hillary clinton now taking stage in north carolina. %$* 0
we've been listening to donald trump, but as soon as hillary clinton speaks, we will listen to her remarks as well. %$* 0
back in to donald trump. %$* 1
almost 1:00 in the morning. %$* 0
i think they said 18,000 people here. %$* 0
every corner. %$* 0
look at this. %$* 0
every corner. %$* 0
and you know what they'll say? %$* 0
donald trump is speaking before a crowd of people. %$* 0
these people are the worst. %$* 0
he's speaking in front of a few thousand people. %$* 0
at the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. %$* 0
the trade policies of hillary clinton from nafta to china to korea to the transpacific partnership which by the way is a disaster. %$* 0
have raided your factories, crushed your auto industry, and gutted your communities. %$* 0
you know it. %$* 0
and she's not -- look, folks, honestly, you can give her a shot. %$* 0
you're wasting your time. %$* 0
you're wasting your time. %$* 0
she's not going to be able to do the job. %$* 0
she's not going to be able to do the job. %$* 0
just look at her record. %$* 0
but forget her record. %$* 0
she's not going to be able to the job. %$* 0
she doesn't have a clue. %$* 0
michigan has lost more than one in four of its manufacturing jobs since nafta, a deal signed by bill clinton and supported by his lovely wife, hillary. %$* 0
right? %$* 0
right? %$* 0
by the way, you know who i spotted in the audience? %$* 0
mayor rudolph giuliani. %$* 0
rudy giuliani. %$* 0
he's got energy, that guy. %$* 0
he's all over the place. %$* 0
he's going from place to place to place. %$* 0
got a lot of energy and a lot of this up here, too. %$* 0
america has lost -- listen to this -- 70,000 factories. %$* 0
70,000. %$* 0
not 700, not 7,000, 70,000 factories since china entered the world trade organization, another bill and hillary backed disaster. %$* 0
we are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. %$* 0
there's never been anything like this. %$* 0
our jobs are being stolen like candy from a baby. %$* 0
not going to happen any more, folks. %$* 0
there are going to be consequences. %$* 0
there are going to be -- when they fire our people, our great people, who have been working for 25, 30 years at these companies. %$* 0
they fire our people, there are going to be consequences. %$* 0
it doesn't work that way, not anymore. %$* 0
and the politicians have been working on this problem for 15 years, for 20 years and it's so simple to solve. %$* 0
delphi laid off 3,627 workers and moved their jobs to mexico and other countries. %$* 0
ft automotive laid off 166 workers in auburn hills, beautiful place, and moved their jobs to mexico. %$* 0
chrysler laid off 5,300 workers and moved their jobs to mexico, china, and to other countries. %$* 0
ford laid off 2,155 workers and moved their jobs to mexico and many other countries. %$* 0
now ford is moving all of its small car production to mexico. %$* 0
isn't that wonderful? %$* 0
it used to be the cars were made in flint and you couldn't drink the water in mexico. %$* 0
now the cars are made in mexico and you can't drink the damn water in flint! %$* 0
what the hell? %$* 0
man. %$* 0
unbelievable. %$* 0
unbelievable. %$* 0
is that true, though, or what? %$* 0
unbelievable. %$* 0
you know i have a friend, he's the biggest in the world at building plants. %$* 0
that's what he does. %$* 0
he builds plants. %$* 0
he said build an apartment, he wouldn't know what to do. %$* 0
he builds plants. %$* 0
the biggest plants in the world. %$* 0
most sophisticated plants. %$* 0
all kinds of plants. %$* 0
i said how are you doing? %$* 0
he's from this country. %$* 0
loves this country. %$* 0
loves this whole area. %$* 0
loves you people. %$* 0
he wants to do them here. %$* 0
so i said, let me ask you, how are you doing? %$* 0
he said unbelievable. %$* 0
and i said, oh, that's good, that's good. %$* 0
where are you doing well? %$* 0
mexico. %$* 0
i said what about our country? %$* 0
not so good. %$* 0
he said, donald, you have to see what we're doing in mexico. %$* 0
we're building some of the greatest plants anywhere in the world. %$* 0
and i said isn't this sad? %$* 0
isn't this pathetic? %$* 0
we're going to change it around. %$* 0
i want mexico to build great plants, but we're going to build great plants also. %$* 0
it's got to be a two-way street, folks. %$* 0
it's got to be a two-way street. %$* 0
and right now it's a one-lane highway right into these other countries. %$* 0
they take our money. %$* 0
they take our jobs. %$* 0
they build their plants. %$* 0
they build their factories. %$* 0
we end up with unemployment and drugs. %$* 0
that's what we end up with. %$* 0
not going to happen any longer. %$* 0
a trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving america and we will stop the jobs from leaving michigan. %$* 0
that i can tell you, 100 percent. %$* 0
if ford or another company wants to fire their workers in michigan and move to another country and ship their products back into the united states, i will pick up the phone, myself, if i can -- because i love it. %$* 0
they don't want me to do that, folks. %$* 0
i want to do it. %$* 0
it's so easy. %$* 0
i love doing it. %$* 0
it's like i'm a natural, but i'll have plenty of great representatives. %$* 0
but we -- we -- i'm going to do it every once in a while, i don't care, because i love it. %$* 0
we'll be calling the executives at ford or whatever company is and we'll tell them very nicely that if they want to move their factory or their plant to another country, they will have to pay a 35 percent tax when they sell their cars or their product back into the united states through what will soon be a very, very powerful border. %$* 0
so they'll pay a tax and here's what -- lemon:  all right, everyone. %$* 0
hillary clinton now speaking in raleigh, %$* 0
north carolina, introduced by the former president, her husband, bill clinton. %$* 0
let's listen in. %$* 1
thank you, all! %$* 0
thank you! %$* 0
thank you! %$* 0
well, i got to tell you, this is sure worth staying up for. %$* 0
it is so great to be here in raleigh, here at north carolina state university! %$* 0
and i cannot imagine a better way of ending this campaign than having the opportunity to see all of you and to watch and listen to lady gaga... %$* 0
...one of the most inventive, creative, and passionate performers, whose range goes from "a" to "z" and beyond. %$* 0
and i was watching on the screen not only her perform, but all of you jumping and singing and waving. %$* 0
it was great! %$* 0
because you know what? %$* 0
that's what i want for america and the young people of america, the joy, the passion, the intensity. %$* 0
and you know our long-time friend, jon bon jovi was with us -- %$* 0
he was with us up in philadelphia where he and bruce springsteen sang. %$* 0
and jon said, well, hey, i want to go down to raleigh and so here he is. %$* 0
and you know, between now and the time the poll closes tomorrow, we are going to be living on a prayer. %$* 0
i was really impressed when everybody's hand went up saying you'd already vote. %$* 0
well, go find somebody else who hasn't voted, ok? %$* 0
bring out your friends, your roommates, strangers on the street. %$* 0
just stop and talk to them about what's at stake in this election because north carolina is key. %$* 0
and it's not only important for our election. %$* 0
are you ready to elect roy cooper as your next -- %$* 0
well, i sure hope so. %$* 0
i sure hope so. %$* 0
and i hope you're ready to elect linda coleman, your lieutenant governor. %$* 0
and how about dan blue iii for state treasurer? %$* 0
and i really, really hope you will send debra ross to washington! %$* 0
now we are all fired up! %$* 0
when we were with the president and michelle in philadelphia -- %$* 0
you know, the president was talking about how absolutely consequential this election is, and of course, it is. %$* 0
i really believe it's the most important election of our lifetimes because we've never had a clearer choice. %$* 0
never. %$* 0
it is a choice between division or unity, between strong, steady leadership or a loose cannon, who could risk everything. %$* 0
it's a choice between an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. %$* 0
and it -- %$* 0
it is a choice that really goes to the heart of who we are as americans. %$* 0
what i saw before i came in and what i see now is a sense of potential, of joy. %$* 0
there is no reason, my friends, why america's best days are not ahead of us if we reach for them together. %$* 0
we don't have to accept a dark and divisive vision for america. %$* 0
tomorrow, you can vote for a hopeful inclusive, big-hearted america. %$* 0
our core values -- our core values are being tested in this election. %$* 0
but my faith in our future has never been stronger. %$* 0
i love our country and i believe in the american people. %$* 0
and i know if we bring everyone together we can set goals and we can move toward them and we can feel that sense of accomplishment that comes with being part of something bigger than ourselves. %$* 0
you know, one of the great, one of the great privileges of crisscrossing the country as i have in this campaign is meeting remarkable people. %$* 0
people who stand up against the odds. %$* 0
people who, like my late mother, people who understand that everybody gets knocked down. %$* 0
what matters is whether you get back up, whether you believe you can keep going. %$* 0
last night in manchester, new hampshire, i had the honor of being introduced by an extraordinary man, khizr khan whose son captain khan was killed serving our country in iraq. %$* 0
you may remember mr. khan's speech at the democratic convention, and again last night he reminded us of the responsibility we all share to protect and defend our constitution. %$* 1
